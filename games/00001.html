    <h3>Chrono Trigger [SNES] (NOT FINISHED)</h3>
        <p>
            I tried playing this but it didn't really grab me like the Final Fantasy<br>
            series did, and to be fair, I only really finished FF7.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know why, it's such a critically acclaimed game and I thought it<br>
            be similar to Lunar Silver Star Story but it wasn't really, I don't know<br>
            why. Like in paper, it should be something I liked but I didn't.
