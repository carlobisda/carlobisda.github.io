      <h3>Tiling Windows Managers</h3>
        <p>I've been fascinated with Tiling Windows Manager for a while now.<br> 
          It's one of the features of Linux I've been really interested in <br>
          utilizing but never really implemented. Personally, I think I'm just <br>
          so used with a desktop environment while using a mouse and keyboard <br>
          setup. Going into a tiling window managers that forces you to a more <br>
          keyboard and shortcut setup, I just feel like the K&M setup is more <br>
          versatile.</p>
        <p>As well, I use Windows DE alot as it's more versatile than Linux <br>
          distributions (in a sense where I don't really have to look for software <br>
          alternatives in Linux, Windows software environment is robust and I have <br>
          plenty to look for - as well, gaming is not smooth enough for me). And the<br>
          vaunted customization that Linux distributions is slowly being erased with <br>
          the Linux subsystem that Win10/11 started to implement.</p>
        <p>The way I see it, I will only really implement a TWM for systems that are <br>
          really low-spec or a couple of generations behind as they are low resource <br>
          alternatives to DE. For me to put a TWM in my Win10 box would not make sense <br>
          as I already run it in a low spec system and adding an extra layer would not <br>
          be optimized.</p>
        <p>Mind you, I still enjoy some of its features like layout customization. I <br>
          run PowerToys and the recent updates has a tiling layout system that I've <br>
          implemented - it's mostly for my 2nd monitor and when I need to split windows <br>
          in my main monitor. NVIDIA also has something similar that I didn't test out. <br>
          I've also seen some newer ones pop out for windows like fancyVM (not that new <br>
          lol), workspacers and komorebi - if I see something interesting about them, I <br>
          might gander to try them out.</p>
        <p>I'm still itching to try it out though, maybe when I end up finally installing <br>
          ArchLinux from scratch - I'll probably run it with a TWM instead of a DE. Until <br>
          that time, I can only keep looking at REDDIT/UnixPorn for eye candy.</p>
