    <h3>Manjaro Arch x i3</h3>
        <p>
            I ended up switching to this distro because Arcolinux XD x DWM was kinda<br>
            slow for my laptop, don't get me wrong - the laptop is a potato but when<br>
            the internet says Arch is one the most minimalistic Linux distro out there<br>
            and coupled with DWM, one of the most minimalistic DE in production - you would<br>
            think it should be able to run smoothly in a potato laptop but it didn't, it was<br>
            laggy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To be fair, I know the type of distros that works really smoothly with said laptop<br>
            ; Tiny Core/Tiny Paw & Puppy Linux (Xenial) so I know how the computer is supposed<br>
            to feel in an OS that works with it. And in paper, Arco/DWM worked accordingly (RAM &<br>
            CPU usage) but using DWM, switching between terminals and running programs like Firefox<br>
            felt so laggy compared to TinyCore openbox implementation or Xenial. I'm just really stubborn<br>
            about using an Arch distro because I want to learn a distro somewhat thoroughly and I feel<br>
            like Arch is the distro I want to do it with.
        </p>
        <p>
            So with that said, I switched to Manjaro but this time, using an i3 DE since I tried to install<br>
            openbox using Arco/Calamares but it failed consistently for some reason and I was just getting<br>
            aggravated by the failure to install (tried a couple of times, various of ways). Also wanted to<br>
            try and see what was all the hype with i3 and after a quick install, it feels nice - there is a<br>
            slight lag but it's like a millisecond compared to DWM second, it's barely noticable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So I'm gonna keep running it, install some of the programs I want in it and see if it starts to lag<br>
            , I hope not because I would really like to work in the Arch environment for the foreseeable future.
