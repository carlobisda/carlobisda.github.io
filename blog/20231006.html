    <h3>My First PC</h3>
        <p>
            I remember my first PC quite fondly, I can't remember the architecture<br>
            it was but I feel like it was really old school, way before Pentium 1s'.<br>
            Could be a 286 CPU really, I remember the 2 5 1/4 floppy drives, it didn't<br>
            even have a hard drive. I ran DOS off the floppy disk and had some sort of<br>
            DOS manual on hand. I only had the basics of programs and utilities and had<br>
            Zork, Ancients Art of War and Rogue.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't remember what I ended up doing with that thing before we got a Pentium<br>
            1 from Radio Shack but I do remember getting a used x286 laptop which was super<br>
            cool as it had a dial up modem where I can log in to BBS (that's a whole another<br>
            story for another time LOL)
        </p>
        <p>
            Back to the desktop, I remeber BASIC was on it, some sort of File Explorer, EDIT<br>
            but what I really learned from that PC is command line scripting (which is something<br>
            to this day still adore and utilize with Windows 11 lol). I actually got pretty good<br>
            at it as I tried to reverse engineer and clone programs that I didn't have access to.<br>
            My greatest work was creating a GUI ASCII frontend for all the stuff that I ran.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a noob PC enthusiast, and a new immigrant in Canada, there was some rough bumps along<br>
            the way - like I ended up formatting the original DOS floppy disk because I interpreted<br>
            the description of the program as "optimization" (boy was I wrong lol).
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, it was a blast - I didn't really game on that thing, I played Ancients Art of War<br>
            alot but not gamer alot and even though I played Rogue and loved the idea and design of the<br>
            game - I never actually finished it. Heck, I found Zork too hard as well LOL. I did alot more<br>
            tinkering with that PC, see how I can push it and what it can do. I didn't even learn how to<br>
            program till I built m@1nfram3 as I was more of a hardware tinkerer.
