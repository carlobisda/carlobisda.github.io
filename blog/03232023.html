    <h3>My Everday Carry [2023]</h3>
        <p>The concrete ninja in me has always been keen to ideas like urban prepping, <br>
        camping, etc - such that I've always had some sort of EDC kit on me whenever I <br>
        leave the house. This is seperate from my bugout bag which is more customized <br>
        for a more post-*.* survival scenario where I feel like I would end up in the <br>
        rural/forest area.
        </p>
        <p>So my normal everyday carry consist of.....<br>
        <b>Cellphone:</b> Kinda really important in modern times, so useful.<br>
        <b>Lighter:</b> Because I'm a smoker (lol) but also important if you need fire.<br>
        <b>Multi-tool:</b> Never really found a use for it till I got a car and then just<br>
        little things that I need it for start popping up, especially for prying things.<br>
        <b>Pills:</b> Meds for headache and allergy.<br>
        <b>Self Defense Tool:</b> I have one but mostly for intimidations, my brain and my<br>
        physical strength is my main self defense tools.
        </p>
        <p>Some might ask, where's my emergency med kit (lol). This EDC is mainly when I go out<br>
        with some tools to help me out, not necessarily for me to survive when the zombie<br>
        apocalypse occurs. Like I said, my bugout bad exists for that reason (lol). And to be fair,<br>
        it's situational as when I drive, I don't really take some stuff or when I'm out skateboarding<br>
        obviously the things I carry differentiate.</p>
        <p>It's just the act and practice of having an EDC with you gives off a sense of vigilance<br>
        that I think is helpful and productive for a person.</p>
