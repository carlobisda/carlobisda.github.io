    <h3>AMD Athlon X4 Club</h3>
        <p>
            Today, I decided to finally overclock my home server. This was the<br>
            first computer I ever owned and bought by myself, over a decade ago,<br>
            and it was pretty much my workhorse till my sister bought me the Optiplex<br>
            3020 a couple of years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only reason I decided to overclock this because I was trying to OC my<br>
            3020 to no avail (so far), seems to be OEM lock but TBH; if there is a will,<br>
            there is a way. (and I got all the time in the world to wait for someone to make<br>
            it happen LOL)
        </p>
        <p>
            With that said, see below; so far I've been able to overclock this system with up<br>
            to stable numbers mentioned below. Anything above that, the computer will shut down.<br>
            Now I need to figure out RAM overclocking without the hassle of bricking my system and<br>
            me having to pull out the CMOS battery to restart MOBA. GPU overclocking should be ok.
