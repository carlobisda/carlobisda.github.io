    <h3>Android TODO App Using Flask</h3>
        <p>
            I've been learning how to do some data engineering recently and the<br>
            chapter that I am on essentially is about Flask so I decided to learn<br>
            how to create a TODO list app that I can port towards Android.
        </p>
        <p>
            A TODO app you say, how boring? LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well to be fair, a todo app is kinda been done already but I'm thinking of<br>
            something a bit more spicy for my app. Essentially, I want the app in Android<br>
            as the frontend but I want the backend (aka Flask) to access the DB locally<br>
            in my computer where I can run a more sophisticated system that can tie in<br>
            with my personal page.
        </p>
        <p>
            So calling what I'm thinking of creating a "TODO app" kinda does it a<br>
            disservice IMHO. I prefer to think of it as a "Life Dashboard" or a "Productivity<br>
            Tool" something akin to the cyberpunk video game dashboard. Eventually I want to<br> 
            be able to tie it in with smart watches and whatnot, a fullstack life monitor.
