                    <h3>CARLOBISDA DOT COM v2</h3>
                    <p>Today, I decided to do something a little different with my domain.<br>

                      Previously, I’ve only been using WordPress as the main front page and CMS but today, I decided to separate the 2 entities; the main/front page will be a custom work programmed by me and for the technical writing part, I decided to create a subdomain (blog dot carlobisda dot com).<br>
                      
                      Why did I decide to do this?<br>
                      
                      First, I was initially drawn to web design by interesting web designs in the late 90s’ (anyone remember those geocities pages?). I especially remember the anime inspired blogs that was full of spunk and the design reminds me of a more cruder aesthetic that Persona 4-5 follows (pastel colors, extravagant and “cool” designs). The front end design these days are lacking…. imagination to say the least.<br>
                      
                      Even my initial offering, it very much follows the “guidelines” of todays proper web design but as I eventually get back into the hang of graphics editing and HTML’ing, my front page will eventually become alot more eye-catching (maybe I can make dual versions of the site monkaHmmm).<br>
                      
                      Secondly, my writings will always be somewhat be technical so I didn’t want the front design taking anything away from it – thats why I ended up choosing this very minimalist wordpress theme (Moina Lite). I might eventually write a custom one again once I feel like coming up to the modern standards of wordpress theme’ing but for now, I like this anyways.<br>
                      
                      Anyways, see ya space cowboys…..</p>
