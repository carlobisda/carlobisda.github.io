    <h3>Dirty Forties</h3>
        <p>
            I turned 40 on May 5th, a week ago or so.....
        </p>
        <p>
            TBH, it doesn't really affect me except that I'm in the halfway point of<br>
            my life, if my life is ending around the 80s' mark. While I don't feel rushed<br>
            , I do understand that for some things in my life - I'm running out of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like I want to be a multi-millionaire already.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to have the physique of a spartan already.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went for my general checkup with my doc post triple-bypass and he said that<br>
            I'm healed as much as I can, it's already been a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lets go then.
        </p>
