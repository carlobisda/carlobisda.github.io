    <h3>Manjaro XFCE</h3>
        <p>
            I've been running my new desktop setup for a little bit now, running pretty<br>
            vanilla, not alot of mods on Win10 - TBH, I'll prolly run this for a month<br>
            or so then start thinking of ways to modify my setup. With that said, I always<br>
            have an alt OS running; just because for shenanigans but this time around, I want<br>
            my own custom Linux distro that I can deploy in any PC that I want Linux on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the time, I just kinda employ TinyCore  just to get it running but like<br>
            I said, I want my own flavour/setup ready to go. It's been like this since I ended up<br>
            using Scoop for Win and I wrote a Powershell script that installs all the base programs<br>
            that I use (I love package managers in Windows since I restart my main PC all the time, so<br>
            much easier to reset computer).
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, I always have in mind that the PC that I will end up using is underpowered,<br>
            since I have alot of them laying around the house, so I had to decide on using a light<br>
            weight distro. I ended up choosing Manjaro XFCE flavour, TBF I could've just used<br>
            vanilla Arch but installing in a virtual environment sucks and I wanted something kinda<br>
            already setup so I can start playing with it. Eventually, I will do the vanilla Arch way<br>
            from scratch one of these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to have an customized, lightweight OS that is easy to setup on to other computers.<br>
            It will also serve as a base for my custom projects, test out stuff. I doubt I will move my<br>
            development work from Windows but we'll see - maybe I'll find it easier to do programming work<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            So why choose Manjaro XFCE? Well, I know I love the Arch distro and it will always be my base<br>
            - to be fair, I love Arch, TinyCore and PuppyLinux but the latter 2 I believe is not as <br>
            supported as Arch - and I'm too much of a functionalist to build my own programs for said <br> 
            distros' when one is already way supported by the community. Secondly, I needed a desktop <br>
            environment - some stuff just doesn't work well without a DE and I chose XFCE since it was<br>
            the lightweight.
        </p>
        <p>
            What are my goals with this project? I don't like the bloat of Kali so I'm going to build my<br>
            distro for what I will use it for; mostly RE & OSINT stuff, some malware stuff, and recon stuff.<br>
            Basically, anything I want to do in the down low - I will run it through this distro.
        </p>
        <p>
            One step down, a couple thousand more to go.
