    <h3>Dream Interpretation'ing</h3>
        <p>
            I'm 50/50 on dream interpretations, like I do them but I don't hold so much weight<br>
			on it. It's a personality thing as I always feel like I can overcome anything thrown<br>
			at me. Personally, I actualy have no use for dream interpretations since I rarely<br>
			remember my dreams and only a few instances where I did remember, mostly being chased<br>
			by a monster.
        </p>
		<p>
			Recently though, I've had a couple of instances where I dreamnt of driving my car, turn<br>
			right and then plowing through a deep pothole. I remember being distinctly angry about the<br>
			pothole and how it was ruining the tires of my car. I remember this I guess because of how<br>
			angry I felt.
		</p>
		<p>
			So I ran the dream interpretation via Microsoft Copilot and this is what it gave me..<br>
			<b>Driving A Car:</b> symbolizes my journey through life and hitting the pothole may represent<br>
			unexpected challenges we are facing.<br>
			<b>Hitting A Pothole:</b> symbolizes your frustration over things in life not going smoothly as<br>
			one expected.<br>
			<b>Anger Management:</b> 'nuff said, I do have some anger issues LOL.<br>
			<b>Self Reflection:</b> the pothole could be an event/situation in your life that is causing you<br>
			distress.<br>
			<b>Adaptation:</b> the whole dream itself can be interpreted as a reflection of your attitude towards<br>
			life. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The interpretation itself makes sense. I feel like this is logically possible but personally, I don't<br>
			feel like it applies to me as I'm pretty good with handling my emotions and facing adversity head on.<br>
			I'm the type of person who just powers through everything and let the wind blow to the direction it will<br>
			blow - a devil may care attitude is what I feel like is appropriate for me. In general, dream Interpretation<br>
			already I feel like is very subjective and generalized, I've always been an outlier so I'm not sure this will<br>
			apply to me but it's a good practice, I think. It helps with introspection and maybe, it could be right too - <br>
			I'm not completely dismissing it.
