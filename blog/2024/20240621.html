    <h3>My Fighting Game History</h3>
        <p>
            I love fighting games, I've been playing them since I was a kid but recent<br>
			outings hasn't gotten me excited. Recently, Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6 was<br>
			released but I'm just not excited to jump into it.
        </p>
		<p>
			My fighting game history is based off the console LOL, I didn't really get into<br>
			arcades until much later in my teens.
		</p>
		<p>
			I remember my first fighting games were for the SNES; Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat<br>
			TMNT: TE & Killer Instinct. I used to rent them all the time from Blockbuster and<br>
			play with my siblings and friends. One of my sisters friend older brother had an<br>
			imported DBZ 3 fighting game for SNES which was crazy good, I still play it sometimes<br>
			on emulator, also there was a Gundam fighting game that was understated.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Then PSX came with Rival Schools, Street Fighter Alpha, Tekken 3 (one of my all time<br>
			favorites) and later on Marvel Vs Capcom and Bloody Roar. Maybe these are not considereda<br>
			by FGC fans as a pure fighting game but Bushido Blade 1 & 2 was my jam as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the arcades, I saw Street Fighter 3rd Strike, one of my favorite fighting games of all <br>
			time - I still play it to this day, and Marvel vs Capcom (which I bought the PSX version for,<br>
			which was not the same). Then the arcardes kinda died off here in Canada and I wasn't really<br>
			console gaming anymore - kinda switched to PC at the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then one of the places I worked at, I found out that my co-workers were fighting game fanatics<br>
			so I ended up getting into the PS3 generation of fighting games; Ultra Street Fighter IV Turbo,<br>
			Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3, Virtual Fighter 5 I believe, Skullgirls and Divekick. Then I ended<br>
			buying the SF3rdStrike Online Edition, I missed the MvsC2 in the PS store unfortunately.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also have a PSP FGC history, I used to play Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Marvel vs Street Fighter<br>
			alot on these when I finally managed to root the darn thing (also Bushido Blade).
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, in my PC gamer arc; I have Tekkern 7, Street Fighter 5, Skullgirls, Hellish Quartz, Brawlhalla,<br>
			Dragonball FighterZ, Idol Showdown, Killer Instinct, Multiversus, Sclash, Soul Calibur 6 and Smash Legends.<br>
			There's probably some other games that I didn't list, like I have a bunch of old school King of Fighters<br>
			in my accounts or some indie ones I can't remember.
		</p>
		<p>
			So I've played alot of fighting games, I prolly forgot some TBH - like the ones I've played through<br>
			emulators or through other various "means" but my point is that recently, there hasn't been any new<br>
			fighting games I'm excited for - the recent Tekken and SF just doesn't have the same pizzaz as the<br>
			other games I've really loved. I'm not really sure what they are missing that I just can't get into<br>
			them. Like I've had Brawhall installed for years now but only managed to play a couple of hours of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll prolly pickup SF 6 and Tekken8 when it goes on sale. The only game I'm really thinking about it maybe<br>
			SClash and Soul Calibur 6. Of course I still play 3rd Strike and I'll probably boot up Ultra SF 4. IDK, those<br>
			games I like but not the future incarnations. I still love the genre thought but I'm just not obsessed<br>
			with it anymore.
