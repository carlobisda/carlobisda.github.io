    <h3>Wilson Blade v6 No CV</h3>
        <p>
            This was initially going to be my tournament racket but unfortunately,<br>
			it got lost in the ebay transport system for awhile, to a point where<br>
			ebay didn't even know where it was and issued a refund to me, and didn't<br>
			penalize the seller (so we both win technically, moreso me LOL).
        </p>
		<p>
			I ended up choosing to buy another pair of rackets (Prostaff Six One 95S) which<br>
			I now adore so the Blades are going to be my backup rackets. The plan is to string<br>
			one in my normal string and tension, and the other one in multi - just to give my<br>
			arm a rest some times as I've never really ran a full bed of poly for a whole "season"<br>
			and I don't know the final outcome.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I mentioned before, I ran my KFactor Tour 90 with Alu Power Rough at 59lbs and<br>
			I did develop some arm "soreness" in the beginning. I could count that as being so out<br>
			of practice and my technique wasn't even close to passable (tech still needs some more<br>
			work LOL).
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm still in my tennis string journey, trying to fine tune that setup (among other things<br>
			like serve mechanics, strategy, etc) so this might change eventually.
