    <h3>Tennis Obsession</h3>
        <p>
            I'm really into tennis right now, I don't know why - it's like a fever high,<br>
			it is a full blown obsession and I love it. So here I am trying to dissect why<br>
			I am so high about it right now, maybe I can figure out and replicate with my<br>
			other passions like chess or breakdancing, robotics, etc. So much interests but<br>
			so little time and drive to do it - it makes me wonder, if I'm not obssessed like<br>
			this with any of the other interests in my plate, is it really an interest of mine?
        </p>
		<p>
			Is it because it's a sport? I mean I love martial arts, breakdancing and basketball<br> 
			as well but I don't think I've ever gotten hit this bad by this bug. Maybe it's because<br>
			I set a goal I'm trying to achieve for it? lowkey I'm planning to do some UTR flex tourneys<br>
			and probably join a club (Unionville Tennis Club is looking good right now, and when I say<br>
			that - I mean the price as the one closest to me is double that SHEEEEESH). Maybe I should<br>
			add goals in my interests and see if I get hooked like this.
		</p>
		<p>
			And when I say hooked, it's bad. I've literally just think about tennis a good chunk of my<br>
			time. I watch tennis videos in youtube and instagram, I play tennis alot of times these<br>
			days and networked with so much people. I bought new (used) rackets for tourney play and<br>
			now thinking of what kind of strings I should run, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			I want to be obsessed like this with other things so I can progess faster, what is the secret?
