    <h3>De-Prioritizing Chess</h3>
        <p>
            I think	that for now, I will de-prioritize becoming a professional chess gvmer.<br>
			A part of me still wants to go and become a National Master but the reality of<br>
			things is that I haven't even been motivated or excited about playing chess, heck<br>
			I haven't even looked at chess for months now.
        </p>
		<p>
			I understand that I'm not a genius chess player and that I will have to work a hundred<br>
			folds in comparison to the others who are more natually inclined to the game. There's<br>
			probably other games that I can become pro at much faster rate and chance than chess <br>
			but TBH, no other game has come close to the presitige and class that chess brings (maybe<br>
			the closest one is Go or Shogi, probably Go NGL). Heck, I can probably be considered pro once<br>
			I start winning in Brawhalla tournaments.
		</p>
		<p>
			With that said, its not like I'm completely taking chess of my life, I love it too much and it's<br>
			one of the things that connects me to my old man. I'm moreso hard scaling it down and will still <br> 
			train but not focused on becoming a National Master. Just closer to a more semi-casual training <br>
			environment. NGL, I don't think I can do any training in life "casually", my soul demands I put a <br>
			100% effort lol.
		</p>
		<p>
			Maybe once I do that, my fire for chess will be reignited again. I'm just gonna simplify my training<br>
			regimen and not set a scheduled date/time for it on my regular daily schedule.
