    <h3>My Federer Racket Collection</h3>
        <p>
            I am such a Wilson nerd, all because of my GOAT Roger Federer. He really was<br>
			the one that really fueled the fire of love for tennis. I try to take and learn<br>
			as much as I can from him.
        </p>
		<p>
			And with that, of course I am trying to collect all of the racket models he ever<br>
			used. Granted I know that most pros' say they endorse a racket but are completely<br>
			using a different type of racket but for the most part, I think Federer somewhat<br>
			used the model similar to the retail version, with slight difference, and probably<br>
			high end materials in the mold.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like I believe for sure he used the Ncode and the Kfactor as they were so different<br>
			and was clearly not like previouse models. Maybe in the RF97 phase, he was using<br>
			something different but I think the retail models are close to what he was using.
		</p>
		<p>
			2 out of 14 rackets to go LOL. sad part is, this is not even my complete wishlist.<br>
			I have other rackets that I want to get.
