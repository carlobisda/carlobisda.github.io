    <h3>Gamedev is hard AF</h3>
        <p>
            I decided to write a simple rougelike RPG game to "help" me pass the time<br>
			at work. NGL, I'm pretty good at my job but I don't feel like overextending<br>
			myself (done that a zillion times and it never really pays off) so I keep<br>
			my mouth shut and just stay bored.
        </p>
		<p>
			I tried looking for one online, I would've thought someone would've created<br>
			one by now but I guess CLI games are a dying breed. TBF, I wanted a pure text<br>
			RPG and the ones I found are pretty fancy (aka graphics) so I ended up deciding<br>
			I want to build one myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some background, I've been on and off with gamedev. It's not something I'm terribly<br>
			passionate about but the creating part resonates hard with my artist self so I've tried<br>
			a couple of times here and there, nothing serious. I've tried to make a text adventure game<br>
			using FICS i think, then I've messed around with RPG Makers of the world, mods, custom FPS<br>
			engines, map editor from Quake 2, Javascipt framework for mobile, and recently Godot.
		</p>
		<p>
			I find the idea intriguing but I've never actually finished or published a game. So like I've<br> 
			said, I decided to write a simple game via Python.
		</p>
		<p>
			But oh boy, this is a rabbit hole.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm in the brainstorming part of the process I suppose and initially, I was just thinking of<br>
			doing something pretty simple but as I go about this; I started thinking of different systems<br>
			or what kind of world/theme am I going for, etc etc and now, I'm stuck with so many ideas of<br>
			systems I want to implement (different scenarios, deckbuilding'ish, etc) that I'm stuck at this<br>
			phase of creationg.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm kinda too familiar with this feeling as I'm a musician as well and most of us gets stuck in this<br>
			perfectionist sort of process that you never actually release or polish the song because you keep<br>
			thinking you can do more with it. I essentially hated that feeling as I've seen it with my friends<br>
			as well so I circumvented that by focusing on the release of the song, prioritize releasing the song<br>
			and you can do whatever you want after.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's the feeling that I have but since this is a different environment, my brain hasn't rewired yet<br>
			to the solution LOL. Hopefully, I just plan and simplify, have a working model, then I can amend later<br>
			on to add whatever cool features I can think of.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wish me luck LOL.
