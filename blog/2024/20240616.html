    <h3>Fathers Day</h3>
        <p>
            Today was fathers day, and the first Fathers day without my father.<br>
			He passed away last year, which was real sad. I may not look or sound<br>
			like it but I feel it; mostly I feel anger as to why my father is gone<br>
			while scumbags still roam the Earth. That's why I can never believe in<br>
			Catholicism, that a sentient being is in control of the universe, because<br>
			if I did, all of my hatred and anger will go towards it.
        </p>
		<p>
			I would rather prefer to live in a world where everything is mostly random<br>
			and that my old man just drew a bad draw in life - then I don't blame anything<br>
			but the shitty world mechanic.
		</p>
		<p>
			I naively wish that my old man has moved on but logically, I think this was the<br>
			end of his story. Now it's time to do my part to continue this story.
