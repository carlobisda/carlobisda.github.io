    <h3>Weekly Review - 08042024/h3>
        <p>
            July is finally the first profitable month for my side gig, a cool $400, not bad at all.<br>
			Still waiting for my tennis rackets, MADGE and SADGE, because I waited so long for them to<br>
			arrive, still waiting. If it fails, I would be more pissed because of the wait - I could've<br>
			bought other rackets to prep for tourneys.
        </p>

			<b>Wealth Macro Goals:</b> Boost the sales side of things, should I add another revenue stream<br>
			or should this be enough? TBF, I'm also working on a trading/investing system so with my day job<br>
			, plus my sales and trading - that's 3 streams, and technically if I do some sales in Traingle,<br>
			that's an EZ 4th stream. The current goal is to have a consistent $200 extra a month.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Physical Macro Goals:</b> Cut has been going slow but I feel like it's working. I feel like I'm<br>
			retaining more muscle due to a higher level of protein I'm consuming. Maybe I'll do a kamikaze cut<br>
			one of these days, I'd really would like to get back to 200-190lbs is my ideal weight.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Misc Macro Goals:</b> Need to get back to chess'ing, pick an opening repertoire and stick to it.<br>
			Trying to get back into guitar'ing as well.
