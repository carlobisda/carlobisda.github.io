    <h3>Week In Review - 06232024</h3>
		<p>
			Not satisfied with this week but I always feel like I should be doing more but<br>
			just not motivated. With that said, motivation isn't the key here - I need to<br>
			be more disciplned with what I need to do.
		</p>
        <p>
            <b>Trading:</b> I'm happy with this alpha I found but I need to polish<br>
			it more, need more to find more confluences, more filters. As well, I need<br>
			to build the tools that'll help me review a pairs and make an informed<br>
			decision. I also need to deep dive into candlestick patters, I need more<br>
			patterns in my head so when I'm reviewing pairs, my brain can discern what's<br>
			a reoccuring pattern.
        </p>
		<p>
			<b>Physical:</b> changed my meal plan but stuck to the game plan of 1000cal<br>
			200g of protein, it's so hard to pull this; I'm going to hit 1300 cal to meet<br>
			200g of protein. I'm going to stick to this current iteration for now. Need<br>
			to work on my physical activities and training. Currently on an athletic style<br>
			of training and alot more focus on specialization, but I need to think of the<br>
			training program. Focusing more on shoulders, calf and chest for hypertrophy<br>
			, the rest for explosiveness. The goal, always, is to have an explosive body.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Misc:</b> Meditating somewhat regularly, need to polish up this practice,<br>
			strengthen this practice in my life. Need to conserve my mental energy from my<br>
			day job so I have more energy for my real tasks in the afternoon, need to also<br>
			do more, create instead of consume.
