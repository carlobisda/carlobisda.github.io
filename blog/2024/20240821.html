    <h3>Wilson Prostaff Six One 95S</h3>
        <p>
            When I thought I wasn't going to get the Blade v6 that I ordered, I started<br>
			looking for other rackets to main for tourneys and such. My main criteria for<br>
			rackets were old school rackets, like a decade ago or so, need to be at least a<br>
			pair of them, and preferred Wilson but I woulnd't mind a Yonex or a Babolat.
        </p>
		<p>
			I searched through Ebay and Facebook and found some likely candidates; there was a<br>
			pair of BLX 95s for around $100 I was eyeing in Ebay. In FB, there was also a pair of<br>
			BLXs' that was in better condition but the seller never replied back to me to confirm<br>
			pricing, A pair of Ultras' that was intriguing, a 3 piece of KFactor 95 (and I think one<br>
			of the 3 was actually new), a pair of ProStaffs 97 v13, some Babolat Strikes and Pure Drives(br>
			and lastly PS SixOne 95S.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was contemplaying between the ebay BLX and the KFactors since BLX was highly touted but<br>
			it looked like it was really in bad shape, I would've been taking a risk. The KFactors looks<br>
			good and I love the KFactor series, also the pricing would end up as 100$ a racket is solid.
		</p>
		<p>
			TBF, I had the 6.1 95S in my queque to buy as a wishlist and I looked at it again properly and<br>
			found that these are the spin versions of their models, kinda rare and kinda discontinued.<br>
			Essentially, Wilson started a spin variations of their rackets but the string bed config (18x16)<br>
			is a prominent string breaker. I think in their modern lineups; only the Burn uses that 18x16 string<br>
			bed pattern.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyways I didn't really know all of the things above till I bought the racket and dug in deeper (lol).<br>
			I essentially decided this as the 95S was something different, the stats and reviews held it and good<br>
			regard, and it was technically brand new (like brand new not used, plastic in grip is still there) even<br>
			though the model was essentially released many a years ago.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I'm tinkering with the setup for tournament play; so hard since there are so many variables to test and<br>
			align with to get the perfect resonance. From grip, to weight distribution and balance, to strings setup etc.<br>
			First thing I wanted to address was finding a durable strings that won't break but will also not break my arms<br>
			lol. I'm still testing setups but I'm liking the low tension setups at the moment; Grapplesnake M8 feels pretty<br>
			good and its around the med-soft type. I was looking for something cheaper so I decided to try out Solinco <br>
			Confidential (and TBF, it's only a 5$ difference but it will add up eventually) and I liked it but it felt kinda<br>
			dead, I like how the strings react and stuff just the feel is so dead so my next test is to either go even lower<br>
			, like 35lbs, or go pro-lite mode which is using hybrid setup; i'm thinking technifibre multifeel on the main and<br>
			confidential on the crosses.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also put some lead tape on the 12, 3 and 9 position,a couple of grams only making the racket be around 360g, which<br>
			will likely be around 350 swingweight. Initially I liked the weight since technically, my KSix One Tour 90 is around the same<br>
			weight and I love playing with that bad boy but maybe, I can't handle it for 6 consecutive hours. I took off the lead tape<br>
			on the 12 pos but I feel like I want/need to keep the 3 & 9 to increase stability. Not sure, once the fresh restring is done<br>
			, I will take off all the extra lead tape and try to test it again. [EDIT: i took the lead tapes off but didn't restring yet,<br>
			I might go for a full bed of Confidential again at 45/41]
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, the racket is good - spin is great and I can drive the ball if needed. Frame feels like it's cutting through the air<br>
			quickly, similar to Babolat. 95 is kinda forgiving head size but you still can get the pinpoint power of a 90 inch. Haven't broken<br>
			any strings yet but I can already see some notching in Confidential after 20 hrs of gameplay. Maybe the weakest part about it is the<br>
			serve but most of the time, I feel like it's my technique LOL. Maybe Ill change the 2nd racket as a "light" version, same string specs<br>
			but no lead tape and synthetic grip instead of leather.
		</p>
		<p>
			[EDIT: My current setup is no lead tape, leather grip around 360g strung weight. no idea what swing weight is, prolly around 350'ish<br>
			grams. Solinco Confidential at 41lbs transitioning to 45/41lbs maybe)
