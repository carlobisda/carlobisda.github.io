    <h3>Week In Review - 07072024</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Wealth:</b> need to allocate more resources into wealth acquisition.<br>
			It's not that I'm not interested, I'm just mentally beat - need to figure<br>
			how to refresh myself in the afternoon so by the time I get home, I'm ready<br>
			to rock and roll. Just low energy, probably the meds keeping me down but the<br>
			point is that I need to circumvent it lol. I feel like hacking in itself is <br>
			demon arts, always shades of grey no matter how much glossty paint you put on<br>
			it.
        </p>

            <b>Physical:</b> Still around 225lbs but it looks like I gained 1% more muscle<br>
			than my previous check in (end of May basically). TBF, how can I honestly calculate<br>
			my physique besides getting into the professional medical tools - I just kinda gauge<br>
			by the number, which I hope is checking the proper spots and just the eye and feel test<br>
			. If I still feel bloated and also slow then my current gauge is working just fine.
        </p>
		 <p>
            <b>Misc:</b> Pro level forehands is hard, I got golfers elbow now but I feel like it's<br>
			better than getting tennis elbow, but I'm slowly changing my game - fine tuning it to<br>
			get to a awesome college level player. Focusing on athleticism and strategy.
