    <h3>My Tennis - 2024</h3>
        <p>
            I've been playing tennis for more than 2 decades now. I've mentioned<br>
			it before to my friends that I always thought tennis was such a dumb "sport"<br>
			until I started watching Prince of Tennis and after that, I thought it was the<br>
			coolest shit ever. I don't even remember how I started watching it since before<br>
			anime wasn't as accessible as it is right now. I love the show so much I have the<br>
			DVDs' I bought from Pacific Mall. Baby Steps is pretty damn good too.
        </p>
		<p>
			Also around that time when I was getting into tennis, the golden era of real tennis<br>
			was about to start; the GOAT Roger Federer was on the comeup, Rafael Nadal was right<br>
			behind his heels and finally, the third king; Novak Djokovic (and the whole Serbian<br>
			tennis movement was happening, who remembers Ana Ivanovic *yum) just entered the battle<br>
			field - it was a good era with lots of characters, one of my favorites is Juan Martin Del<br>
			Potro, the gentle giant with a cannon of a forehand. Justine Henin-Hardine (my female GOAT<br>
			pick) was also killing it, and who can forget Maria Sharapova.
		</p>
		<p>
			Such a good time of tennis.
		</p>
		<p>
			My own game initially was heavily influenced by Djokovic - especially in the beginning of<br>
			my formative years, I used to read up on his strategies and techniques but eventually, I<br>
			moved on to researching Federers skill set. Fed just had more beauty in this game and I<br>
			really loved the one-handed backhand (I started with a double-handed backhand) and his<br>
			volley skills (touch is such a big part of my game now).
		</p>
		<p>
			When eventually it was time to buy intermediate racquets, of course I chose a Federer<br>
			racquet and that started my whole journey into racquet customization, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>So far, my tennis gear list;</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Wilson K-Factor K-Six-90:</b> My first racquet, the one I currently have - I actually just<br>
			bought used off Ebay as the original one I bought, I ended up trading with my brother (he still<br>
			has it as he is also a Federer fan) for a Prince racquet, which I still have. I just love the<br>
			racquet, I feel like it has the reputation of being a racquet for a skilled player; smaller head,<br>
			control oriented, etc. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My current setup for this is Lux Alu Power Rough, 16x19, 59/56 lbs of tension. Lead tape on bevel and<br>
			4 & 8 position. The theory is that shifting the weight lower than our previous setup (lead tape was on<br>
			top of grip and 3 & 9 position) will give us a faster swing but still have the buff of being a weight<br>
			racquet and stabalize the racquet when receiving volleys.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Babolat Pure Drive Roddick:</b> This is the Andy Roddick "model". My thinking around the time was that I<br>
			needed more easy power, especially on the serves but when I started to try it, I felt like there was<br>
			alot more spin generated but not noticable power. I added lead tape like my old KFactor and it got<br>
			more oomph but the spin had to be generated with better timing. It felt heavy for some reason but<br>
			TBF, I was using golf lead tape at the time as it was the only ones available.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lead tape on 4&8 and bottom shaft, new grip and overgrip as well. Need this restrung, prolly try a different<br>
			string on this. I will probably try to keep this as the same scheme as a game racquet, control/spin oriented<br>
			and stuff.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Prince O3 Tour:</b> The Maria Sharapova model I believe. It's in rough shape, just needs some more TLC. Will<br>
			probably tune this for a practice, baseline type racquet, more power for flatshots, less spinny, etc. I like<br>
			it though, feels like a flexible racquet.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Wilson SledgeHammer 3.8:</b> I don't know where I got this racquet from but it's kinda fun, ngl. Gonna change<br>
			the grip and see if my racket stringer (yes, I have a guy lol) can restring this bad boy. It's so old I'm not even<br>
			sure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Personally, I still have a couple of rackets in my wishlist; Wilson HyperHammer 5.3 (as a tribute to Justin Henin),<br>
			I'll try to find a stretch midsize but I don't think I'll find her specific EU version with power holes and ProStaff<br>
			RF97 v13 and ProStaff v13 (just for fun and also to add to my Federer collection), maybe an old ProStaff in Sampras<br>
			era (big fan of Pistol Pete as well) but those are the ones I'm in the look out for. [EDIT] I think I might get the<br>
			Wilson Hyper Pro Staff 6.1 95 (a homage to JMDP). I mean it seems like a lot of racquets but TBH, half of these are<br>
			cheap if you buy them used off ebay so LOL. My collection is gonna jump up soon.
		</p>
		<p>
			I just love tennis as a sport and some people just don't understand how physical the game is. This is the only sport<br>
			I feel like closer to MMA/fighting sport; one on one, technique or power styles, conditioning and endurance, like a<br>
			real fight by blasting the ball at each other in insane speeds. Even though it's called a gentlemen sports, there's<br>
			really nothing very gentle about blasting a forehand past your opponent.
