    <h3>Science & Spirituality</h3>
        <p>
            Even though I am a man of science, I mean I love it and I truly believe it's<br>
			an integral part of the universe. I'm also open to the idea of human spirituality.
        </p>
		<p>
			Personally, I just don't believe that science has achieved 100% understanding of<br>
			the universe so there are bound to be holes in the worldview; like for example,<br>
			what is gravity actually? what is dark matter? etc etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			We've made good observations in regards to the universe that heaviliy rely on an<br>
			emprical study but that can only explain to a certain extent.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I believe is that there are phenomenons' in the world that exceeds our current<br>
			understanding of the world and when we try to debunk said phenomenons, we are utilizing<br>
			the tools we currently have. But what if these said tools can only grasp a certain amount<br>
			of information and it's not getting the whole picture.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm not trying to convince anyone about my ideas, feel free to believe how you want to believe.<br>
			This is just the way I look at the world.
