    <h3>The Concquerer</h3>
        <p>
            The process is kinda fun it its' own way but TBH, I prefer winning and then moving<br>
			onto the next goal to concquer I know the modern "meta" for lifehacking or productivity<br>
			hacks is that of enjoying the process, don't be so tied up to the goal, etc.
        </p>
		<p>
			That might work for most people but not for me. And I'm not even being disparaging about<br>
			this, this is purely my opinion and based on my personality and attitude about life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eastern philosophy often emphasizes the journey over the destination, suggesting that the<br>
			process of striving to achieve the goal is where one finds true meaning and value. I whole<br>
			heartedly disagree with this. I don't know how to explain it but personally, it feels like I'm<br>
			running away from my goals. I mean it sounds nice to trust the process (KEKW) and that detaching<br>
			oneself from the goal will lessen the mental and physical burder and I agress with this somewhat<br>
			but I don't completely agree on detaching oneself from it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Personally, I like to be reminded of my goal; it helps my drive, it inspires me to go harder,<br>
			be smarter on how I go about reaching my goal. Maybe it's the next generation type of thinking<br>
			but most people are gamers and what do gamers like seeings? Their achievement badges going up lol<br>
			It is so satisfying when your complete a task (in game) and seeing that achievement badge up in<br>
			dashboard. Or farming for hours just so you can get a certain gear set, etc etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			If all else fails, I just stick to my personal philosophy of balance, have one eye on the goal while<br>
			one eye on the process, just personally balance is the way. Objectively, I feel like 60% on the goal<br>
			and 40% on the process is my actual paradigm.
