    <h3>Sunrise of my Life</h3>
        <p>
            Recently, I did my 2024 1st quarter assessment for my life, it's nice to get your thoughts in order<br>
            and organized so I can work on the next steps of my life plans.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a planner, for all intents and purposes, I like my life having goals and directions and<br>
            achievements - my whole life is kinda like what happens when you gamify someones real life. My life<br>
            is not about the journey but the achievements - what did I accomplish in my life, etc etc?
        </p>
        <p>
            Its been quite some time where I felt like I was just in some sort of a haze, didn't help that I was<br>
            very inebriated most nights with the mary jane. For the past couple of weeks, I've just been fighting<br>
            this mental demon of mine - trying to shock myself out of this fog. The hunger to fight feels like it's<br>
            napping or just woke up from a deep sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been trying real hard to get at it, I restarted my workout regimen. I'm crystalizing my plans<br>
            for additional stream of income; I have the Rhythm Sales, Forex Trading, Triangle sales and some high <br>
            risk gambling as planned additional income streams, I'm also contemplating getting into the content<br>
            creation business, focus on an evergreen type of content that has a high yield like personal finance<br>
            topics. I am trying to simplify alot of things in my life so lessen decision fatigue and I'm slowly<br>
            sharpening my mental blade until it cuts no problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trying to go back to my old ways; simplify, specialize, minimalize, essentialize. Only use what is<br>
            useful and throw away the rest. I will be happier not being tied down, let me be free LOL.
