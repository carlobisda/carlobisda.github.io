    <h3>Week In Review - 06302024</h3>
        <p>
            Still stuttering around but at least I got to play alot of tennis<br>
			this week. Maybe I'm just that fatigued and taxed, with everything<br>
			pulling at me. Maybe I need a dopamine detox LOL.
        </p>
		<p>
			<b>Wealth:</b> Making some progress but I need to step it up! Do things<br>
			faster, looser, devil may care attitude - live fast, die young, and leave<br>
			a good looking corpse. Need to build my forecast tools, and need to build EA<br>
			so that I can see it LOL. Need to be inspired by dirty deeds, need the spirit<br>
			and flow of money to always be intergrated on myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Physical:</b> Like I said, lots of tennis involved this week - working on<br>
			my forehand and serve, fine tuning the mechanics. Physically, I've been on my<br>
			low cal/high protein meal plan for a week now. I feel like I am losing body fat<br>
			albeit somewhat slowly but it's happening and I'm gaining more muscle mass, some<br>
			what slightly.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Misc:</b> More mental practices needed, more discipline on this - meditate,<br>
			spiritual practices, etc.
		</p>
