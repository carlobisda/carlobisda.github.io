    <h3>AI Journey/h3>
        <p>
            With the influx of AI tools coming about, and the feelings of worry<br>
			from the peoples who think AI is a tool that will eventually be too<br>
			much for humans to control. Personally, I've been enjoying the stuff<br>
			I can do with it, especially in regards to rapid application development<br>.
			Don't get me wrong, it is so nice that you can just lay out simple programs<br>
			with the correct prompt but with that said, I still think you need some<br>
			understanding of programming as alot of times, the code that chatGPT spouts<br>
			out isn't exactly the best.
        </p>
		<p>
			I more see it as a tool and eventually when it becomes too powerful, or something<br>
			, I'm hoping I don't get targeted because I embraced the technology first hand.<br>
			(LOL)
		</p>
		<p>
			So far, I have a couple of tools that is in my rotation for practical usage and<br>
			eventually, once the parts for my computer upgrade come, I can finally work on<br>
			my personal GPT using my journal as a knowledgebase. I also want to create a <br>
			chessGPT so I can have it annotate some games akin to the Deep Fritz program<br>
			(probably the only chess program I've seen that has detailed annotation, theres<br>
			probably new cloud based ones online that I haven't really checked yet though).
		</p>
		<p>
			Below are the AI tools I'm currently using:
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>chatGPT:</b> the grandfather of AI GPT. I love it and I still use it to this<br>
			day as it is updated pretty well.<br>
			<b>vircuna-wizard-uncensored:</b> similir to chatGPT but uncensored so the topics<br>
			you can't really do in chatGPT, this is my alternative.<br>
			<b>Google Collab:</b> I just started using it and I find the code it outputs is pretty<br>
			workable alot of the times, compared to chatGPT where you really got to baby it to<br>
			get the correct output.
			<b>Microsoft Copilot:</b> I just started using this but more so for image generation.<br>
			I think it's unlimited but tbf, I haven't hit the cap yet so all is good.
			<b>Ollama:</b> a platform that serves as platform for local based GPT. it's a framework<br>
			so you can setup LLM locally in your computer.
			<b>git/github:</b> so I can download and setup LLMs locally, but manually, compared to Ollama<br>
			where it's pretty much click click boom. I used it for AI tools that is not covered by Ollama<br>
			such as XTTS tools so I can clone my voice.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, I love the AI tools as it helps me get my work down faster. Feels like my productivity<br>
			has been up since discovering and implementing this in my workflow. I'm look at this new framework<br>
			called Fabric, it looks like it can help summarize anything for you but I'm sure it can do more<br>
			things, that aspect was the thing that really stood out to me. I would like to do more things with<br>
			AI tools, like recently, I've seen some sort of Jarvis looking setup which I thought was really rad.<br>
			I also want to setup my own rabbit type gizmo but that's a bit far off at the moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyways, hail my AI overlords.
