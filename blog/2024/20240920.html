    <h3>Peak Performance</h3>
        <p>
            I'm 40 right now and I'm trying to reach my human peak performance.
        </p>
		<p>
			It's not because I'm having a quarter life crisis or anything, I just<br>
			want to be able to move at the pace that I want all the time. And I<br>
			enjoy a wide variety of sports so I prefer to have an athletic body<br>
			that can basically do it all.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of Sept 20th, I've been receovering from an ankle sprain I guess from<br>
			the marathon tennis tourney I did a couple of weeks ago. One of the things<br>
			I have to remember are my "protocols" like post-match or injury protocols.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Like it's pretty simple but I need to write it down all the time so I can always<br>
			reference or remind myself. I feel like since it happens rarely now, but when it<br>
			happens - I gotta crawl my way around to find my meta protocol, which could've wasted<br>
			a couple of days of potential clean healing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even recently, I was thinking of cutting again but I don't have any real records of<br>
			how I did it the last time.
