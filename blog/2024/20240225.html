    <h3>My Health Stack [May 2024 Update]</h3>
        <p>
            I'm actually a big fan of supplements, I just think it's so hard to properly<br>
            maintain your bodies nutrient needs. For example, an adult needs around 3400mg<br>
            of potassion daily - that's like 6 medium potatoes daily. Now think about it, are<br>
            you able to take 6 potatoes a day? Exactly, pretty hard. To be fair, my "stack"<br>
            isn't exactly voluntary - I've had a history of high blood pressure and recently<br>
            , I had to get a triple bypass. It had been quite the road to recovery and I'm <br>
            still not a 100% but recovery has been great, no complications.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that said, below is a list of medicing that I have to mandatory take, and<br>
            voluntary ones that I feel will help me live a long life.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Main Stack:</b><br>
            Aspirin: acts as a blood thinner.<br>
            Clopidogrel Bisulf: acts as anti-blood clotting.<br>
            Metoprolol Tart: lowers blood pressure.<br>
            Entresto: heart medicine for post-heart surgery.<br>
            Jardiance: blood sugar control medicine.<br>
            Rosuvastatin: heart medicine for post-surgery.<br>
            Amlodipine Besylate: lower blood pressure.<br>
            One A Day Multivitamin: multi-vitamin<br>
            Webber Vitamin C: boost immune system.<br>
            Webber Vitamin E: I mainly take it for health of your blood, brain and skin<br>
            Natures Bounty Probiotic: probiotic booster, nuff said<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Can't have too much potassium as my daily meds already kinda boosts that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Alt Stack:</b><br>
            Greens Powder Smoothie Mix: <br>
            Pure Protein Powder Chocolate:<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            My alt stack is mainly for maintainence and for working out. Most of my meals are<br>
            are carbs or protein, not alot of veggies most of the time so I got the supergreens<br>
            smoothie mix - the protein is obviously for gains.
        </p>
        <p>
            TBH, if I didn't get sick - I would've never realized how my body ran on empty fuel<br>
            most of the time. It is so interesting for me, if it wasn't a life or death thang lol<br>
