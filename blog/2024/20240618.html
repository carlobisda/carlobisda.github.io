    <h3>StrengthFinder 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            I think I saw this from a youtube video but I ended up buying the book<br>
			from a used bookstore. The idea that the book itself presents is not new<br>
			, our ancient brethren has been doing this already but I feel like it<br>
			wasn't mainstream or anything with the ancients, like this type of thinking<br>
			will get you labelled as a heretic and burned in a stake LOL.
        </p>
		<p>
			I couldn't do the test officially since it was the used book and the original<br>
			code has been used already so I had to kinda read the descriptions of the themes<br>
			in the book then just kinda picked the one closest to my way of thinking.

			<b>Achiever | Strategical | Adaptability | Activator</b><br>
			Achiever is what I classify as a "hard skill" as it permeats my very way of thinking<br>
			it's something that I actively drives me everyday and brings me joy. Strategical is<br>
			my default way of thinking, dial it in amp it up lol. I classify this as a soft skill<br>
			as for the most part, I don't actively have to "strategize" - it's more like a default<br>
			way of thinking. Adaptability is a soft skill that is something that is ingrained within<br>
			me and Activator, a hard skill, that I'm always trying to level up. Essentially, this <br>
			theme is super active if it's stuff that I want to do, now if I can have this trigger for<br> 
			the stuff I hate doing too, I'll be machine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interesting book. I've done something similar years ago on my early twenties as I was doing<br>
			some soul searching around that time, trying to find who I really am and what made me tick.<br>
			Mind you, the "test" I took more than a decade ago was ancient and relied on personality traits.<br>
			I've done some online tests here and there, Myers Briggs, etc. This was the first one that I've<br>
			dealt with that's pretty modern.
		</p>
		<p>
			My current gameplan to implement these and hopefully enrich my plan is to make todo lists and<br>
			once it's on the list, just get to it. Or when I choose to do or buy things, it has to be<br>
			something that fits my current themes or if there is multiple choices, prioritize then items<br>
			that will strengthen me.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I feel like this is something cool, not sure if this is actually revolutionary. But at least<br>
			it simplifies some processes in my life.
