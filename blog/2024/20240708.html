    <h3>Some Chess Thoughts.....</h3>
        <p>
            I stopped playing chess for awhile now, lets say either I burned out<br>
			from it (which is possible with the way I go at things) or has just been<br>
			bored with it (which TBF, I've been bored about alot of things lately) - both<br>
			quite plausible.
        </p>
		<p>
			But sometimes, it just takes a little thing to inspire me back into playing<br>
			mood - this time it was a youtube video from a creator called "chesspage1"<br>
			where he was explaining the KID setup for black in a video called "The Only<br>
			Opening you need as Black" and of course, the META CHAD GVM3R that I am, I<br>
			was instantly piqued. Now I want to try this setup because I was playing<br>
			with the Scandinavian for the last while now and while I like it, it just<br>
			doesn't sit well with me - now this ain't logical whatsoever, just a gut<br>
			feeling but I'll take it. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Maybe the idea of trying new things is the way to get me excited about chess<br>
			(or life in general) but the thing is, I think trying out new things all the<br>
			doesn't give you enough reps to build on it as a strength (and this is something<br>
			I am inherently against, following the philosophy of Jeet Kune Do; and I paraphrase<br>
			; throw what is useless, keep what is useful).
		</p>
		<p>
			But if I don't try new things, how would I find what I really like (in life, chess<br>
			women, etc). I think the only thing I've found that I'm really into are guitars (my<br>
			Gibson SG), tennis (Federer rackets) and computers (Intels i7s', etc).
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyways, much ado about nothing - I can only step forward and keep on trucking.
