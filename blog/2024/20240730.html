    <h3>Play More Video Games</h3>
        <p>
            I feel like I should play more video games..... there I said it lol.
        </p>
		<p>
			I was thinking about it yesterday and the rest of the time is kinda comprised<br>
			of watching youtube and while for some parts, its educational - the rest<br>
			is not and is just kinda noise running in the background per se. It's up to<br>
			the point where I sometimes put it on just for white noise, not really listening<br>
			or anything.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the old adage goes, you gotta use it or you lose it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I feel like it's the same death scroll that TikTok or IG provides, just mind numbing<br>
			sounds that doesn't involve your brain to logically think, just getting bombarded with<br>
			noise. I feel like I'm losing alot of mental activity because this kind of consumption<br>
			doesn't really do anything while playing video games at least involves thinking, using<br>
			that noggin to solve certain events.
		</p>
		<p>
			So I'm gonna cut down on youtubing, and play more video games LOL. who would've thunkit?<br>
			I was just thinking of deleting all the PC games I installed because I thought video games<br>
			in general is a waste of time but now thinking about it, it's prolly better than incessant<br>
			youtube, and now this opens a whole lot of other possibilities.
