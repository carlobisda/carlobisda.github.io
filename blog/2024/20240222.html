    <h3>Hacker Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            I was going to write something witty here but for the life of me,<br>
            I can't remember. Anyways.....
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, I feel like the word hacker has lost its' original meaning.<br>
            These days, if you say hacker - you're either a game cheater or you're a<br>
            cybersecurity professional. Personally, I still subscribe to the old school<br>
            definition which is somewhat of a rogue techie who likes to tinker with things.
        </p>
        <p>
            And this is not my old man shaking fist at cloud moment, I sincerely feel that<br>
            when I hear the word hacker, they are describing something very foreign to me.<br>
            The closest thing that follows the mentality of an OG hackers are the hardware<br>
            hackers, they just tinker and build shit just for the heck of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, we use this frontend Win95 looking program to enter orders and shit.<br>
            For certain accounts, there is a cap of how much they can spend on their credit. One<br>
            of the accounts I take care of is constantly over their limit and I have to get a <br>
            supervisor to override and confirm the entry. Well I enter alot of orders for this<br>
            account and I got sick of asking a supervisor to override and approve all the time<br>
            so I started thinking on how to circumvent this option.
        </p>
        <p>
            After thinking for abit, I decided to try something and it worked. Now I never have to<br>
            ask my supervisor over just so she can confirm my orders and I just enter away at my<br>
            leisure.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be fair, what I did wasn't tech savvy but I feel like it's in the spirit of hacker-fu.<br>
            I looked at a system, explored and found a loophole, and I circumvented the security.<br>
            I'm pretty sure there's a good reason why the cap is there but after observing for a <br>
            couple of months now, safe to say there's no actual imprint on what I do to our ecosystem.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I miss the days when hackers just hack shit just out of curiousity, I guess we're<br>
            still out there but I haven't found my kin yet lol.
