    <h3>Wilson KFactor KSix One Tour 90 - A Retrospective</h3>
        <p>
            The Wilson KSix-One Tour 90 (aka the KFactor Tour 90) is a racket that <br>
			is widely associated with Roger Federer, one of the greatest tennis players <br>
			of all time. Released in the mid-2000s, this racquet was part of Wilson’s <br>
			KFactor series, which was all about making things more stable and easier to <br>
			control with some cool new tech.
        </p>
		<p>
			I remember getting this racket after I graduated from Walmart rackets, buying <br>
			a brand new one off a local tennis shop in Yonge and Finch, don't remember if <br>
			I got the NCode the same moment or afterwards. I eventually passed it on to my <br>
			brother when I bought the Pure Drive Roddick afterwards. Big mistake but he <br>
			still has it to be fair.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I went back to playing tennis seriously a couple of months ago, coupled with <br>
			Federer retiring a year before, it made me want to get the racket again. I manage <br>
			to hunt some good deals from FB market and ebay and has now been rocking 2 of them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Design and Technology</b><br>
			The KFactor Tour 90 features Wilson’s KFactor technology, which incorporates Karophite <br>
			Black. This material is designed to improve the racquet’s strength and stability, <br>
			providing players with better control and feel. The racquet has a 90 square inch head <br>
			size, a 16x19 string pattern, and a 12.5-ounce strung weight, making it a heavy and <br>
			head-light racquet ideal for advanced players seeking precision and control.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Groundstrokes</b><br>
			The KSix-One Tour 90 is highly stable and comfortable feel and control from the baseline. <br>
			Off the shelf as stock, this racket performs unbelievably well, the racquet’s 340g <br>
			unstrung weight provides a solid feel, which helps in generating powerful and consistant <br>
			groundstrokes.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the topspin heavy meta of todays tennis world. This racket can hang with the big boys; <br>
			put in some spin focused poly strings and adjust your technique and you can whip out heavy <br>
			topspin balls with ease. With the rackets head light and 90si head size, you can cut <br>
			through the air nicely and whip balls with relative ease.	
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want a flatter groundstroke, slap some natural gut or multifilament, lower tension <br>
			and feel the flush ball pocketing as you slap a winner down the line.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Serves</b><br>
			As for serves, the Tour 90 continues to impress. The rackets mass and stringbed bite <br>
			contribute to powerful and heavy flat serves. For spin serves, persons technique really <br>
			has to be spot on to get maximum RPMs' but it works well enough with my mediocre technique.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Volleys</b><br>
			At the net, the racket shines with its solid and responsive feel. The racquet’s stability <br>
			and weight make it easier to handle volleys, providing excellent depth and accuracy making <br>
			it a great choice for those who like to play an aggressive net game.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Impact on the Game</b><br>
			The Tour 90 has had a significant impact on the game, its design caters to those who <br>
			prioritize precision and control over power. The racquet’s popularity soared due to Federer’s <br>
			success, and it became a symbol of high-performance tennis equipment.Even though newer models <br>
			have since been released, the KFactor Tour 90 remains a beloved racquet among tennis <br>
			enthusiasts. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Its influence can be seen in subsequent Wilson racquets, which continue to incorporate elements <br>
			of the KFactor technology. The racquet’s legacy is also cemented by its association with one of <br>
			the greatest tennis players of all time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Wilson KFactor Tour 90 is more than just a tennis racquet; it’s a piece of tennis history. <br>
			Its design, technology, and performance have left a lasting impression on the sport, making it <br>
			a timeless choice for players seeking a versatile racquet that excels in all areas of the game, <br>
			making it a favorite among advanced players who seek control, power, and precision.
