    <h3>Casual Tennis</h3>
        <p>
            So I've been doing the networking rounds, trying to befriend as much tennis players <br>
			in my area as I possibly can but for the most part, I've been playing with noobs alot<br>
			. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing with them and teaching them but I wish I'd find<br>
			some people who are competent in their ground strokes, someone who can give pace and<br>
			or topspin balls in for control.
        </p>
		<p>
			I still have my brother and I've gotten him playing on my Babolat PD racket and he is<br>
			doing well with it, nice and deep with some pace. But he's pretty much it and when he is<br>
			busy, I'm out of luck.
		</p>
		<p>
			I do enjoy the teaching though because it's nice to reinforce the ideas by teaching but<br>
			I'm afraid that technical wise, if I keep playing with beginners - it's not enough to<br>
			to sharpen my tools.
