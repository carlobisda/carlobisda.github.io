    <h3>Week In Review - 07142024</h3>
        <p>
            Setting goals, I feel like, is what's going to unlock my capabilities (wowzah<br>
			, BIG insight lol). Let me explain, I feel like the past few years, the idea<br>
			of setting goals has gone out of fashion - the recent trend has been to action<br>
			small habits, small little steps towards the goal but the goal itself is not the<br>
			focus. Objectively, it sounds legit but I guess subjectively, it doesn't really<br>
			work for me, to each their own I suppose.
        </p>
		<p>
			I feel like for me, without that big macro goal spotlight - my focus and drive<br>
			lessens. I need the hype to keep me moving I guess. TBF, I can do with the micro<br>
			small habuts but I feel like it doesn't provide the same impact as focusing on the<br>
			macro goals.
		</p>
		<p>
			So my idea is to start setting goals with a super-specific macro goals details.<br>
			I find that when people critique macro goal settings, the goals set were very generic;<br>
			"I want to be a millionaire" or "I want to lose 20lbs". my idea is that you can do this<br>
			, but add the how - just be more specific about the goal.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Wealth Macro Goal:</b> My current goal for this field is <b>I want to be a millionaire by<br>
			forex trading and gambling means!</b> See how I wrote this goal, I have the goal and the means to<br>
			make it happen. Maybe I can be more specific by adding in the end "by doiing 3-4 trading sessions<br>
			on weekday nights and 1 gambling session on the weekday." Something to this extent.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Physical Macro Goals:</b> My current goal for this area is <b>I want my body to be in an explosive<br>
			, athletic state, a slim muscular 200lbs, good enough to compete in tennis or breakdancing by working<br>
			out almost everyday!</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Misc Macro Goals:</b> I have sub goals for usre, variety is the spice of life but they all kinda hinges<br>
			on achieving the first 2 so.....
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, this is a WIP system.
