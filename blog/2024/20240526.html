    <h3>zzClusterEmail</h3>
        <p>
            I was looking around for a email marketing tool to send emails in batch emails<br>
            for my side hustle and i only really found cloud based ones. I'm kinda familiar<br>
            with mailchimp and hubspot but if I remember correctly, the emails were sent from<br>
            their own specialized domain. I wanted the emails to come from my business email<br>
            address so I ended up going to the rabbit hold of finding offline programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I did that though, I was tinkering around with writing code for this. As always<br>
            I look around for a repo in github that I can just customize for my end but I didn't<br>
            really find anything satisfactory so I ended up going for RAD by utilizing chatGPT.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem I faced was that first, the code ChatGPT gave me wasn't good. I don't know<br>
            why but sometimes, ChatGPT code is just shit, especially for the modern languages. I would<br>
            recommended it for older languages like C or Assembly. A couple of days in though, I ended<br>
            up writing some code in Google Collab and decided to use the AI code generator it had and<br>
            it actually gave me a working code.
        </p>
        <p>
            At home, I was testing out the programs I downloaded. Mail Blaster 9 kept trying to update<br>
            itself even when patched and I was too bollocks to care about blocking it via my firewall<br>
            so out of the picture, then I tried SendBlaster Pro which worked but now I kept having issues<br>
            with the SMPT configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, since I thought my business email address was a GoDaddy setup, I had to use the GoDaddy<br>
            settings but it didn't work. It would connect but it wouldn't send out emails, thats with SendBlaster<br>
            and the custom code via Python. It would connect but would never send out email. I then had the idea<br>
            of using the Outlooks SMTP settings since I have it setup there as well (or GoDaddy uses them by<br>
            default, not sure) and that worked, it connected properly and sent emails when I tried it with the<br>
            custom code.
        </p>
        <p>
            So for a final last ditch effort before writing my own code, I tried it with SB and it would connect<br>
            but not send emails. I tried a couple of things here and there but I eventually just scrapped that idea<br>
            and just decided to finish writing the program.
        </p>
        <p>
            And here we are; zzClusterEm. I named the program based off Cluster bombs. If you don't know what that is,<br> 
            it's basically a missile launched and a couple of seconds later, the front will open up to release hundreds<br>
            of bombs to the target.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wrote the program in Python and as a CLI tool, I might end up doing a win based GUI for it if it becomes<br>
            necessary but I'm pretty happy with it. It takes the important info off config files then launches emails<br>
            in 5 seconds increments, the only limitations it has is based off your server. I think GoDaddy only has<br>
            a 250 per day email limit, not sure so I'll be capping it around 100 emails a day. I like it as a CLI<br>
            program but I do feel like GUI is needed. (easier message editing, maybe different profiles for different<br>
            accounts, etc). I still have to think about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will help immensely with my business and I will release it as open-source with MIT license so everyone<br>
            can use it. With this program, I finally feel like I wrote something useful LOL. Anyways, back to the drawing<br>
            board, still have lots of things to do.
