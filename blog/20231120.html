            Yep, I know bro - 2023 has kicked you in the nuts a couple of times<br>
            then proceeded to kick you while you're eating your own shit on the<br>
            ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're barely sleeping, you're life isn't where you want it to be, body<br>
            is kinda crashing down on you sometimes. etc etc.

            A wise man once said, "what does down, must go up" - which is one of the<br>
            truest things in life so what does that mean for me? Well lady luck favours<br>
            the bold so I need to get my arse moving again, I've just been stagnant - which<br>
            sucks, I feel like I have no direction but the truth is, I have plenty of directions<br>
            , I just don't choose and act.
        </p>
        <p>
            So choose! and act!
        </p>
