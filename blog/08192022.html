                    <h3>Space, The Final Frontier</h3>
                    <p>From Star Trek TNG to Firefly, from the Macross Saga to Legend of the Galactic Heroes – the space theme has been one of my favorite themes of content to consume.<br>

                      With that said, since we don’t (and that makes me sad lol) – I decided to work on finishing some of the games I have in my backlog list (which is a lot). The first one is Mass Effect 2, and the second one is No Mans Sky.<br>
                      
                      I finished ME1 years ago, and I have ME3 on queue. I started ME2 but I never went past like 25% of it, not sure why, most likely life and Ive tried on and off to play it but I just never went through it. The ME franchise is right up my alley, excellent storyline and great game mechanics with plenty of customizations but I guess I needed to ride the story from start to finish to play the whole thing.<br>
                      
                      No Mans Sky is the new game that I’m trying as well. At first, I wanted to see if it’ll work on my potato PC and with low spec settings, it surprising works pretty well. When I initially started playing it, it gave me the Minecraft in Space vibes (I love the Minecraft style of gameplay btw) – it looks like I will enjoy playing it tbh, I am intrigued with the premise of the game.<br>
                      
                      Something about the whole idea of space adventures; the romance, the grandeur, the danger – everything about space adventures screams at my very core in such a way that I wish we lived in a space faring age right now.<br>
                      
                      The wild wild west in space.<br>
                      
                      The greatest romance.<br>
                      
                      See ya space cowboys.</p>
