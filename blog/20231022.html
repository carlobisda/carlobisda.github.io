    <h3>Android Emulators</h3>
        <p>
            I've recently started delving into the Android environment. It mainly<br>
            started to check out games in mobile and to test out the environment<br>
            but mostly to play casual games LOL. My phones currently are not strong<br>
            enough to play the more extensive games so I just emulate it in my main<br>
            PC. Most of the time though, I use it to "play" Raid Shadow Legends.
        </p>
        <p>
            In regards to software, I tend to be loyal to the ones I prefer to use and<br>
            I was using Bluestacks to play in PC. With that said, as I mentioned in a<br>
            <a href="20231014.html">previous post</a> I wrote, I was going to end up retiring my<br>
            run with RSL but ended up changing my mind since I found that I can use LDPlayer<br>
            to offload the time gated stuff to my alt PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            And to be fair, it's been working great.
        </p>
        <p>
            But.....
        </p>
        <p>
            I ended up installing LDPlayer in my main PC as well to use as my main Android emulator but<br>
            after a couple of days of running it, it feels so laggy compared to Bluestacks. I don't get<br>
            it since LDPlayer plays pretty good on my alt (tbf, it's laggy but I expect that and it isn't<br>
            that bad though). I've tried all of the performance tricks I can think of but it's just so laggy.<br>
            I feel like it's something to do with the graphics as I believe Bluestacks is more updated in that<br>
            sense, I can't remember but I read it somewhere about LDPlayer not supporting certain graphics version.<br>
            Either that, or it's just incompatible with my main processing architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I really needed this to work, I would dig a bit deeper but since it's not.....I'm reinstalling<br>
            Bluestacks lol. I hope I made a backup of my settings somewhere.
