    <h3>The Fast Saga</h3>
        <p>
            NGL, I enjoy the popcorn blockbuster summer movies and the Fast & The Furious<br>
            is one of those series. I probably think the 2nd one was the weakest out of all<br>
            the entries and I don't think I ever sat down to watch and finish it (I've see bits<br>
            and pieces of the movie), Tokyo Drift was my low key secret indulgence but FF4 was<br>
            really the movie that shifted the whole theme & idea of the movie - like it got serious<br>
            real quick compared to the somewhat campy'ish, low level stuff of the first 3 movies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't mind when a franchise shifts and I think FF did it really well but somewhere along<br>
            the way, it got too serious for it's own good. From low level crimes to effin secret agent<br>
            shit, sheeeesh. 
        <p>
            Like I understand how Brian can become somewhat good at fighting but everyone else got mad<br>
            fighting skills boost too. Everyone is Doms' life is a secret agent? Like how, his dad was<br>
            a racer, how can someone from that background be connected to so many secret agents? And in<br>
            the latter half of the franchise, the action pieces became more Mission Impossible in cars<br>
            rather than Jason Bourne shit (which I thought FF would be good in, a gritty action franchise).
        </p>
        <p>
            And don't get me started how everyone suddenly gets resurrected out of nowhere. Like I can forgive<br>
            Letty but Hans too, and he's also a secret agent (kinda) who got sniper skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't get me wrong, I still watch it - maybe Fast 9 was the one where I didn't enjoy it as much<br>
            but the break speed, fast and furious story and character changes that comes out of left field<br>
            has maybe started to take a toll on my "break from reality" filter. I might watch FastX when it<br>
            comes out in Netflix, I think I've seen it NGL but I can't remember, that's how memorable the last<br>
            entry was for me.
