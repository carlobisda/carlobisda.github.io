    <h3>Powerless</h3>
        <p>
            There some rumblings in my day job and I really felt powerless<br>
			about it. Like I have some answers that I can do but there was<br>
			no finesse to my answers - basically I could solve it with violence<br>
			but that answer is just so.....meh
        </p>
		<p>
			Like what have I been doing with myself where this is the only resolution<br>
			I can think of.
		</p>
		<p>
			I want to be the man, I want to be HIM.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now what are the steps I need to do to make this happen.....
