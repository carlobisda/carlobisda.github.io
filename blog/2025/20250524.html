    <h3>To Nix or not to Nix</h3>
        <p>
            I've been a long time Windows fan and user, I feel like it has enough<br>
            accessibility features on it for anyone to jump in and work with the<br>
            system but can be advanced enough for users to really make it their own<br>
            Personally, I couldn't see myself switching off because of the gaming<br>
            accessibility Windows has, I'm a gaming fan for a long time and Linux<br>
            was just not cutting it - even though I haven't gamed seriously for so<br>
            long, I just like the ability to just jump in whenever I pleased.
        </p>
        <p>
            But with the looming end of support for Windows 10, and just going straight<br>
            into Win11 - one I'm not a fan of jumping into Windows OS, like I prefer<br>
            stability over the new toy in the block, thats why I stuck to 95, XP, 7, then<br>
            10 for so long. With that said, I feel like Win 11 will just be a bloated<br>
            clusterfook of a mess so what am I to do?
        </p>
        <p>
            As the title mentioned, should I just switch to Linux Mint or something? But<br>
            it's not just gaming where I need to work with Windows; music DAWs are inherentally<br>
            Windows friendly, some other stuff I work on is also Windows only software. Even<br> 
            though I feel like my computer is good enough to run Windows in virtual machine for<br>
            the Windows centric programs I need to work on..... that extra friction just irks<br>
            me LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I guess we'll see where I end up, maybe I'll even forgo the "security" updates<br>
            I keep getting and just install a very low spec debloated version of Windows 10.<br>
            Fluck, maybe I'll just go full monka when the support is officially over and gut<br>
            Win10 everywhere, full customization LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            [EDIT] hmmmmmmm, fully gutting Win10 and do a full custom may not sound so bad after<br>
            all. Well until all the programs I use cannot run on 10 anymore and am forced to go<br>
            to Win11.
