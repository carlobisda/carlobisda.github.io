    <h3>Reassess Everything</h3>
        <p>
            Now that I've started to feel better, I need to re-focus on what I need<br>
            to do with my life. Physically, I can't do much till a year later - maybe<br>
            some cardio but that's about it but I need to keep moving, so I'll prolly<br>
            focus on the mental/intelligence aspect of my life - learn new skills, etc. <br>
            It sucks that I have to start from basically the start but alas, that is life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just look at it positively and think of it as a new canvas you paint on.

            I have so many options to choose from sadly, how do I know I'm in the right path?<br>
            The classic decision paralysis.....<br>
            - chess or go(baduk)?<br>
            - reverse engineering or red team?<br>
            - game development?<br>
            - forex trading?<br>
            - roulette, parlay. gambling?
        </p>
        <p>
            How do I decide?<br>
            Do I just pick them all? LOL
