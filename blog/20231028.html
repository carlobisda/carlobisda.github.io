    <h3>Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
        <p>
            GAWD I love the cyberpunk setting and aesthetic!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            I was playing the "demo" of Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty edition and<br>
            ....ok nocap I downloaded a cracked version because TBH, I really want to<br>
            play it but didn't want to spend then find out I can't run it so I downloaded<br>
            it and after finally deciding to play it before the other games I thought I would<br>
            (trust me, I am backlogged gaming wise, still haven't finished Max Payne and Mass<br>
            Effect II). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Surprisingly it ran well on the lowest setting but it wasn't bad at all since the<br>
            aesthetic isn't realistic, got around 50+ FPS most of the time and when I was in combat<br>
            , there was no lag (compared to Escape From Tarkov sheeesh). With the art style, the lower<br>
            texture didn't look shabby at all and surprisingly, I only had to go to "performance" mode<br>
            , didn't even have to go to "ultra performance".
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, I've seen the game played by strimmers so I kinda knew the beginning story arcs and<br>
            stuff but as I played it, I still found myself immersed in the environment and the story. I<br>
            am totally enthralled by the game, even more so than Mass Effect 1, story and universe wise.<br>
            So I uninstalled the game, wait for it to go on sale, then I will buy it off GOG legitemately.<br>
            TBF, I could've kept playing but I know I'm gonna officially buy the game so I didn't want to go<br>
            too deep in it LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that said, I do love the cyberpunk aesthetic and universe. When I compare the Cyberpunk universe<br>
            vs the Mass Effect universe, I just love the grittiness of Cyberpunk. I just love the grittiness of<br>
            cyberpunk in general, compared to the clean utopian/dystopian universe of Mass Effect - I just gravitate<br>
            more towards the gritty stuff. I think I mentioned this before in my <a href="20230927.html"> SW post.</a><br>
            but I tend to gravitate more to the Mandolorian, Obi Wan, underground settings of Stars Wars rather than<br>
            the main universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to live in that world LOL. How do I make real life into that? It gets my blood flowing nocap.
