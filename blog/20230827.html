    <h3>Am I a Hacker?</h3>
        <p>
            I've been thinking about this kinda recently, just along my journey<br>
            of introspection - am I a hacker? 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look at the recent definition, you might think a hacker is a super<br>
            l33t computer wizard who canpenetrate exotic cyber systems with and take<br>
            down banks and governments and I guess that's what it is because facts are,<br>
            these are these kinds of people who has the most exposure to the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I am not these types of people... I'm not l33t coder, I barely know<br>
            networking protocol. If I were to genuinely surmise my skills; I am an<br>
            intermediate tech enthusiast who knows enough about computers and software<br>
            but doesn't have a specialized skill or mastery. I'm a generalist who is I<br>
            a jack of all trades, master of none.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just made me think as I tried cracking a game launcher mod. I basically own an<br>
            online only game but dislike the online environment and prefers the PVE aspect<br>
            of the game so I found an SP mod but the mod needs the original game installed<br>
            to circumvent piracy, which I didn't like because why do I need 2 copies of the<br>
            exact game.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I tried cracking it manually but got lazy and the idea of patching through via<br>
            already patched cracks had me searching online till I found a manual patch, which<br>
            was close to my idea but was missing 1 component. I installed it and the game works<br>
            fine now but it made me wonder if I can really call myself a hacker because I didn't<br>
            execute a more elegant solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would probably be called a script kiddie back then and today, nocap.....<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The definiton of a hacker might've been interpreted differently by myself as<br>
            I think a hacker is someone who utilizes the best tools they have to circumvent<br>
            a system, but I don't necessarily think that technical elegance is a staple, I<br>
            can make the tool or download it but as long as the result is reached, I think<br>
            it's fine.
