    <h3>Custom Powershell CLI</h3>
        <p>
            I finally got into customizing my command line.... well tbf, I<br>
            finally got out of the generic command line prompt into something<br>
            more interesting looking but tbh, it's not really mine per se - I <br>
            just copied something off the internet but it's pretty nifty, and now<br>
            I know it's possible so I might gander into it more deeply later on in<br>
            my adventures.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's some nifty plugins that can make it super customized but right now,<br>
            I chose a somewhat easier method of just using Powershell commands at the<br>
            moment. I have in my prompt; elevated command, current user, simple folder<br>
            location, date and time, and timestamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess my biggest problem at the moment is finding inspiration on what I<br>
            want to put up there. I mean I like the customization and it does look purty but<br>
            I want something practical up there as well. I love the aesthetic but I love being<br>
            practical more lol.
        </p>

        <p><em>purty, so very purty</em></p>
