    <h3>Practical OSINT</h3>
    <p>I have this little….. game where I play along with a suspicious accounts <br>
      online till they eventually end up asking me for money.</p>

      <p>Sometimes it’s only a couple of exchanges, sometimes its weeks till they <br>
        get to their final ploy.</p>
      
      <p>Today, we meet “Karlee”.</p>
      
      <h4>Like Every Other Story</h4>
      I end up signing to numerous “networking” app in hopes of building up my <br>
      network and finding interesting people with interesting ideas and or endeavors.<br> 
      The newest one I signed up on is “Connected2.Me” – apparently an anonymous <br>
      chatting app on Android and Iphone, somewhat similar to IIRC.<br>
      
      <p>I signed up and stuff and afterwards, anonymous accounts start messaging me. <br>
        To be honest, out of like 50 or so accounts that messaged me – one was real, <br>
        and 2nd one was I think real, but kinda a weirdo (LOL).</p>
      
      <p>One of the “people” that messaged me was this “person” whom we shall call <br>
        Karlee. And lets just say, she was a professional pleasure provider who was <br>
        trying to “market” her services to me.</p>
      
      <p>She sent me some pics and a vid, then she asked me to send her a steam gift <br>
        card for more VIP services. She was really adamant that we should meet up but <br>
        the golden rules of these transactions are 1) never go with someone who asks <br>
        for a full deposit and 2) only see vouched providers.</p>
      
      <h4>All Fake Things Must Come To An End</h4>
      She was playing all the cards but I wasn’t buying, and I was giving her a hard time. <br>
      So much so that if she was a real professional, she should’ve ditched me as I was <br>
      being a pain in the ass.<br>
      
      <p>As a security test, I asked her to send me a selfie of her holding 3 fingers near <br>
        her face. She sent me kinda a selfie but I found it odd that she was wearing a <br>
        PornHub hoodie out of all the things and that kinda set my spider sense into <br>
        overdrive.</p>
      
      <p>So I downloaded the selfie and used Google Image to see if this picture was on the <br>
        internet and lo and behold, it’s a picture of popular pornstar Karlee Grey. You may <br>
        believe me or not (lol) but I don’t watch enough porn to remember porn stars and <br>
        their names so forgive me if I didn’t catch this on the initial pictures but it just <br>
        shows, being wary of everyone online is always a good thing.</p>
      
      <p>Needless to say, “it” stopped messaging me afterwards.</p>
