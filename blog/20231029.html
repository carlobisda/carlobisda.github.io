    <h3>Escape From Tarkov</h3>
        <p>
            I am a BIG fan of Battlestates survival/rpg game, Escape From Tarkov. Like, I<br>
            love everything about it, its' faults and achievements. I really think it's one<br>
            of a kind and the potential of it is mind boggling. With that said, the current<br>
            official state of the game is not to my liking.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always looking for tactical shooters, I enjoyed Modern Warfare and Battlefield<br>
            games but I always revert back to the Rainbow Six franchise as it is closer to what<br>
            I want to an FPS shooter game - then lo and behold Escape From Tarkov out of the blue.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember watching one of Operator Drewski video on it, he was on interchange and he<br>
            ran a long flank so he can get an angle from a PMC and BANG, he got em. When I saw that,<br>
            I thought it was really cool that you can utilize real world tactics so I dug deeper about<br>
            the game and eventually, I pulled the trigger and bought the game (even though I didn't know<br>
            if my potato PC can run it). I also loved Rust but I bought this game before Rust lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was really into Rust because I love the survival aspect, the ability to employ real world<br>
            tactics, and the gunplay and EFT had that like a couple shots of vodka and whiskey as a chaser,<br>
            I knew I was hooked - this was the game I was looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I bought it, and I loved it, but as I eventually kept playing - I realized this game is really<br>
            hard core - like you need to put in the hours to fully play it and unfortunately, I am a casual in<br>
            spending time in a game. I am really against games that needs you to play a certain amount of hours<br>
            in it - I like the technical skill involve in games but I don't like the time sink, that's why I tend<br>
            to gravitate towards fighting games, strategy games and card games - and I avoid games like DOTA or LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can appreciate the skill it takes to play a game a certain level but I don't like it when I'm forced to<br>
            play a certain length. Not only you have put a certain amount of hours to get gudder at the game but now<br>
            you are also forced to play a certain length of a time. With games like Valorant or Counterstrike (one of<br>
            my all time games), you get better with practice but actual rank games wouldn't take 30+mins, same thing<br>
            with fighting games, actual matches last less than 10minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a double edge sword for Tarkov, its what makes it hardcore but deters the casual gamers. I am not<br>
            a casual mind you, somewhere in between the two sides but I really just fathom spending that much time in<br>
            a game.I personally can't understand it, I guess maybe I don't love the game as I thought I did because<br>
            story-driven games, I feel like I can spend hours playing (like Cyberpunk 2077).
        </p>
        <p>
            I also don't like that the game wipes every quarter of a year, I am a completionist most of the time and<br>
            kills my motivation when the game wipes my progress after spending so much hours grinding the game. TBF,<br>
            the game is in perpetual BETA so this is just my opinion, not a critique against the game. It's not the<br>
            same as a Rust wipe because even though it wipes, there are certain quality of life aspects in the game <br>
            that makes the wipe more digestable, and the resources to get you to endgame is not hard to farm. Also, EFT<br>
            touts itself as a RPG so I'm not down to loosing my progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think EFT is still looking for its' identity, like is it a surival game or is it a FPS shooter game. I feel<br>
            like they've done really good with both aspects and both are constantly fighting to be the Alpha of the identity.<br>
            Also doesn't help that the community is torn between the two as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like PVP wise, they need to fix the sound, and make recoil better. For the survival aspect, they need to hunker<br>
            down - like I've always disliked the flea market as it kills off the looting/exploring aspect, they need to tweak<br>
            it like maybe regional flea market - they need scarcity for a survival game and the flea market eradicates that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could go on and on about this game but to close it off, BSG created something that is unique and unforgettable.<br>
            The mixture of everything they managed to squeeze into this game makes it very unique and I am proud to support their<br>
            vision. With that said, I haven't played the last 2 wipes officially and just looking around to see what new changes<br>
            they will bring - maybe I'll start playing again in an official capacity when Arena comes out. I feel like it brings<br>
            out most of the things I enjoy about Tarkov at the; the gunplay and the tactics. 
        </p>

            [EDIT] If only someone would make a DayZ type of environmental mechanics but with EFT level gunplay and mechanics.
