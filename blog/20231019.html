    <h3>Current Software Engineering Tool Belt</h3>
        <p>
            I'm not a "professional" software engineer to be honest, much closer to<br>
            an enthusiast and a freelancer (when I need to be), I've never worked in a<br>
            professional environment and has pretty much been a solo developer for all my<br>
            life so my "stack" (look mah, I'm using the lingo LOL) might not look like what<br>
            others use - also, my tool belt will likely change depending on the project/whim<br>
            I'm currently focused at moment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With that said, I feel like there's been a couple of staples that I've kept around<br>
            no matter what enviroment I'm working with.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Programming:
            </h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Virtual Studio Code:</u></b> I've pretty much started coding with this thing LOL,<br>
            currently writing this blog with VSCode. I tried a bunch of IDEs before just sticking with<br>
            VSCode like Atom, Netbeans, Geany & Jetbrains. Tried some proprietary ones for MQL4 and Python,<br>
            I even tried emacs and neovim (but I feel like I'll try to give them another shot as I just wasn't<br>
            learn-ed enough). I just felt like this was a more robust and user friendly platform to do the stuff<br>
            I wanted to do.... which were shenanigans. TBH, I'm still torn on learning emacs or vim as an alt, or<br>
            maybe a replacement if I see the light LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>GIT:</u></b> In the beginning, I didn't really understand the why - maybe because I'm a solo<br>
            developer so I didn't really think version control was such a problem... and tbf, I still don't <br>
            but I started using it more when I started using github to start developing my portfolio. Personally,<br>
            I just use it as another server to backup my files and github pages, nothing more. I'll probably won't<br>
            deactivate git but setup an alternate, open source personal git server some day.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Windows Terminal:</u></b> This was a new addition to the staples as I really do enjoy the CLI<br>
            enviroment even though I still enjoy the whole DE experiece. I have it open on my 2nd monitor for info<br>
            testing, git, etc. Also been trying to convert most of the stuff that I do in CLI lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Notepad++/nano:</u></b> I think this is the only thing I share with most developers out there<br>
            , a note taking app. I like Notepad++ because it's more robust than Notepad and less annoying than<br>
            Wordpad and Word. nano when I'm in the CLI.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>rando.exe:</u></b> Small program I wrote using Python to randomize certain list items. I'm afflicted<br>
            with decision paralysis and one of the ways I combat that is living the dice life (lol), it's essentially<br>
            a custom dice roller.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Barrier:</u></b> not really a programming tool. It's a digital KVM and I love it. I use to run an<br>
            analog KVM so I can access all my computers but with Barrier, I can link ALL OF THEM. I can be running<br>
            from my main PC and if I feel like jumping to my cybersec laptop, I just move my mouse to that direction<br>
            and voila, I'm still using my K&M going about some dark web spelunking.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Knowledge Tools:</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>ZIM:</u></b> Zim is a desktop wiki which I adopted for personal use as a personal wiki. I couldve<br>
            went with notion but I wanted something light, offline, and in txt files as if I wanted to, it'll be<br>
            easier to upload or modify the files - I uploaded this to my github weekly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Google Chrome:</u></b> Don't hate me, I still use Google Chrome. I just feel like it's so much<br>
            easier to sync stuff since I'm a Google ecosystem enjoyer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Microsoft Excel 2007:</u></b> I've had this suite for years and I still install it in whatever<br>
            windows environment I'm on (also Word and Powerpoint). I'm just so used to it and I use spreadsheets<br>
            alot (current using Google Sheets as a life tracker nocap). It's just a simple way for me to store and<br>
            and keep certain type of datas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Honorable Mentions:</u></b> Playnite, RSS Guard, and Scoop. Playnite keeps track of all my video<br>
            games much easily, before I had to do it manually with a spreadsheet and was eventually going to write<br>
            a program to access the APIs of Steam, GOG, Epic & Amazon but with Playnite, they have a fancy sync function<br>
            with such a nice GUI. RSS Guard is the RSS feed reader I installed, I read my blogs and subreddits off there.<br>
            And Scoop is a windows package manager, need I say more.
