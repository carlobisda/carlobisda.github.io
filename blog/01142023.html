                    <h3>2023 Is What?</h3>
                    <p>To be honest, the beginning of 2023 has been a tad slow for me. Mainly because of the one thing that kinda hinges my progression in this phase, which is a steady job (LOL).</p>
                    <p>To be fair, I am saying a steady job because I need a secure steady stream of income to offset whatever bills I have to pay while I work on my various business projects. While that may sound easy, I add this life caveat which is I need an late night job or essentially overnight because I need my mornings free essentially</p>
                    <p>With that said, I am still working on the various projects; my trading algo is near completion. I essentially just need to program the various tools I need which is taking up the time. My physical self is kinda alright, some kinks here and there but the weight loss focus and back in full force. I have an undisclosed digital project that I'm also working on the side in hopes that it bears fruit somewhat.</p>
                    <p>So what does this mean for my 2023?</p>
                    <p>It has been slow, I admit, but I am still going. Mentally, I need to focus up a bit more - try to set my mental paradigm to a more action oriented focus. Also, I seem to be somewhat in a loss with what to do with my life. Not necessarily what I need to do, more so in what I should focus on, what actions should I fill my life with.</p>
                    <p>I am so focused on META decisions that I am basically paralized with indecision. This is an odd phenomenon for me since I never had this issue for years beforehand. I am somewhat concerned and is trying to troubleshoot this mentality; is it because my mental state has weakened? or was there an event that triggered this? or was it just a slow natural process of decay?</p>
                    <p>It's an odd that thing I need to handle.</p>
                    <p>Focus up, and just do it - you know what you need to do. Get off the porn of self vegetation. Dial it in, amp it up KEKW.</p>
