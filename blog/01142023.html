        <h3>2023 Is What?</h3>
        <p>To be honest, the beginning of 2023 has been a tad slow for me. <br>
          Mainly because of the one thing that kinda hinges my progression <br>
          in this phase, which is a steady job (LOL).</p>
        <p>To be fair, I am saying a steady job because I need a secure steady <br>
          stream of income to offset whatever bills I have to pay while I work <br>
          on my various business projects. While that may sound easy, I add <br>
          this life caveat which is I need an late night job or essentially <br>
          overnight because I need my mornings free essentially</p>
        <p>With that said, I am still working on the various projects; my trading <br>
          algo is near completion. I essentially just need to program the various <br>
          tools I need which is taking up the time. My physical self is kinda <br>
          alright, some kinks here and there but the weight loss focus and back <br>
          in full force. I have an undisclosed digital project that I'm also working<br> 
          on the side in hopes that it bears fruit somewhat.</p>
        <p>So what does this mean for my 2023?</p>
        <p>It has been slow, I admit, but I am still going. Mentally, I need to <br>
          focus up a bit more - try to set my mental paradigm to a more action <br>
          oriented focus. Also, I seem to be somewhat in a loss with what to do <br>
          with my life. Not necessarily what I need to do, more so in what I <br>
          should focus on, what actions should I fill my life with.</p>
        <p>I am so focused on META decisions that I am basically paralized with <br>
          indecision. This is an odd phenomenon for me since I never had this <br>
          issue for years beforehand. I am somewhat concerned and is trying to <br>
          troubleshoot this mentality; is it because my mental state has weakened? <br>
          or was there an event that triggered this? or was it just a slow natural <br>
          process of decay?</p>
        <p>It's an odd that thing I need to handle.</p>
        <p>Focus up, and just do it - you know what you need to do. Get off the <br>
          porn of self vegetation. Dial it in, amp it up KEKW.</p>
