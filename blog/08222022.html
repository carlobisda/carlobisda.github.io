      <h3>My Homelab Setup [2022]</h3>
      <p>I am a BIG tech stack weirdo, I enjoy having hardware tech as much <br>
        as I love software stack. But with that said, I’m not really that into <br>
        the newest hardware. As long as it works for my needs, I will use it; <br>
        brand new or used, low spec or not.</p>
        <p>Currently, I ran a 3 PC setup which are tasked to do different things <br>
          in my whole home lab ecosystem.</p>
        
        <p>PC #1 (aka SiliconTor)<br>
        Dell Optiplex 3020, i7-4790, 16GB, GT730<br>
        HP w1907, RCA TV, Generic Mic, Webcam, Mechanical Keyboard, Mouse, Speaker.<br>
        Win10 Pro, </p>
          
        <p>This was a gift from my sister for my birthday 2 years ago. From a list <br>
          she provided, I told her to get me a Dell Optiplex 3020 Small Form Factor <br>
          PC. Around this time, this PC was really hot for PC builders who were <br>
          looking at cost effective budget builds.</p>    
        <p>Of course that is right in my lane.</p>
        <p>First, I don’t actually use PCs’ to “game” – I do enjoy it and I have a <br>
          ton of them but overall, I like the ability to be able to play (albeit <br>
          somewhat in a lower setting format to get the performance I need) but for <br>
          the most part, I use my PC for various tech shenanigans mostly so I don’t <br>
          require an OP build, just fragile enough to do the things I want (compile <br>
          some programs, reverse engineer some programs, encode videos’, screen <br>
          recording and write various word vomit on certain topics)</p>
        
        <p>PC #2 (aka MAINFRAME)<br>
          Phillips Monitor. ASUS M4A78L-M, AMD Athlon(tm) II X4 635, 8GB, GT710<br>
          KVM Controller. Generic Speaker. Steinberg UR-22, Win10 Pro</p>
        
        <p>Currently my second PC but this was actually the first PC I bought and <br>
          created by myself. I handpicked every piece of hardware for META low <br>
          spec’ness lol. I actually just upgraded some of the core parts recently; <br>
          better processor, better GPU, more RAM and added more utility slots for <br>
          better QOL.</p>
        <p>I mainly use this as a file server, media server and I ran various passive <br>
          projects on it if needed like machine learning shenanigans, running various <br>
          gaming servers or forex price tracker with an EA working in the background.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I will use it for recording music and or as a streaming PC.</p>
        
        <p>PC #3 (aka zupercb-HP113M)<br>
          HP 3115m, AMD E-300, 5GB. ArcoLinuxS</p>
        
        <p>I tried to upgrade the RAM speed for SiliconTor but I think it’s not possible <br>
          to do it in a price range I want. I might get more monitors since one of them <br>
          is kinda damaged but I haven’t really decided. I might end up getting once of <br>
          those PC mini bluetooth keyboard as currently, I am controlling both PC’s with <br>
          the same keyboard and mouse with a KVM.</p>
        <p>Overall, I will end up keeping this setup for a while as I have no aspirations <br>
          to change them unless I completely change the way I am thinking about doing <br>
          something that will force me to change my setup which is to probably get an OP <br>
          PC setup then relegate the other computers down the line.</p>
