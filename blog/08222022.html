                    <p>I am a BIG tech stack weirdo, I enjoy having hardware tech as much as I love software stack. But with that said, I’m not really that into the newest hardware. As long as it works for my needs, I will use it; brand new or used, low spec or not.<br>

                      Currently, I ran a 3 PC setup which are tasked to do different things in my whole home lab ecosystem.<br>

                      This was a gift from my sister for my birthday 2 years ago. From a list she provided, I told her to get me a Dell Optiplex 3020 Small Form Factor PC. Around this time, this PC was really hot for PC builders who were looking at cost effective budget builds.<br>
                      
                      Of course that is right in my lane.<br>
                      
                      First, I don’t actually use PCs’ to “game” – I do enjoy it and I have a ton of them but overall, I like the ability to be able to play (albeit somewhat in a lower setting format to get the performance I need) but for the most part, I use my PC for various tech shenanigans mostly so I don’t require an OP build, just fragile enough to do the things I want (compile some programs, reverse engineer some programs, encode videos’, screen recording and write various word vomit on certain topics)<br>

                      Currently my second PC but this was actually the first PC I bought and created by myself. I handpicked every piece of hardware for META low spec’ness lol. I actually just upgraded some of the core parts recently;, better processor, better GPU, more RAM and added more utility slots for better QOL.<br>
                      
                      I mainly use this as a file server, media server and I ran various passive projects on it if needed like machine learning shenanigans, running various gaming servers or forex price tracker with an EA working in the background.<br>
                      
                      Eventually, I will use it for recording music and or as a streaming PC.<br>

                      Not a PC technically but a laptop. I am running ArchBang on this mostly and other Linux distros like Puppy Linux). I am currently using this for various cyber-tech shenanigans.<br>
                      
                      I tried to upgrade the RAM speed for SiliconTor but I think it’s not possible to do it in a price range I want. I might get more monitors since one of them is kinda damaged but I haven’t really decided. I might end up getting once of those PC mini bluetooth keyboard as currently, I am controlling both PC’s with the same keyboard and mouse with a KVM.<br>
                      
                      Overall, I will end up keeping this setup for a while as I have no aspirations to change them unless I completely change the way I am thinking about doing something that will force me to change my setup (which is to probably get an OP PC setup then relegate the other computers down the line.</p>
