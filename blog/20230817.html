    <h3>An Algo World</h3>
        <p>
            I want to have the infinite money cheat code.....but in real life.<br>
            To be perfectly honest, I think I mentioned it before but I never really<br>
            cared about money and wealth before; my ideal life was being a martial artist<br>
            in the mountains of Osaka training traditional karate, or just being a dumpy<br>
            wannabe rock star - playing music living in crappy studios with my goth satanic<br>
            girlfriend.
        </p>
        <p>
            Somewhere along the way though, that changed, when I realized that money equates power<br>
            these days and I really wanted that kind of power. Digging more deeply, I assume I've<br>
            always been the type that has been tempted or drawn to power - I mean think about it,<br>
            learning karate or being a rockstar is an attempt towards some kind of power, albeit a<br>
            different kind of power but power nonetheless.
        </p>

            So I've been doing my due diligence, learning and training in the ways of currency trading.<br>
            I've always thought that currency trading has the easiest entry level but the hardest type<br>
            of trading to master, epecially these days when quantitative and algorithmic trading are<br>
            basically the staple and the bread and butter of high end traders. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I actually enjoy this era of trading because technology is my jam and I always like to tinker<br>
            with it in ways not really the standard. I may not be a math wiz, nor have a degree in finance<br>
            but I do have the street smarts, and the imagination to think and live outside the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to succeed, and I will succeed.
