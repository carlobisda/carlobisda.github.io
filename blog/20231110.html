    <h3>World of Warcraft Vanilla</h3>
        <p>
            I tried playing WoW again because strimmers are really on it right now and<br>
            I wanted to see what was all the hype. I've played this before but it didn't<br>
            really grab me but lately, I've been watching the King of the Roaches, Asmongold<br>
            alot so I've been kinda familiarized with the game and lore so maybe, I'll<br>
            like it more since I'm more familiar with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose a warrior obviously and I started to play, to feel bored with the game<br>
            10 minutes into it lol.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I just don't like the game, I don't like the design and aesthetic, the lore is cool<br>
            and maybe if the graphics were closer to BDO or Everquest then maybe I'd be more immersed<br>
            but the game design is kinda cartoony. I also don't like the battle mechanics, I'd prefer<br>
            to be either purely turn based or action/timing based, not this click on mechanic, also the<br>
            same reason I can't get into MOBAs' or other MMORPG.
        </p>
        <p>
            Objectively, I don't think anything is wrong with the game itself - it's just not my style.
