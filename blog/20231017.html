    <h3>Learning The Violin</h3>
        <p>
            Alot of my things in my life are inspired by things that inspire me.<br>
            One of my greatest inspirations is Sherlock Holmes; if you understand<br>
            the characters logic, you'd be surprise how easily my thinking can be<br>
            decrypted. With that said, I even took the music part from him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now to be fair, rock and roll had a big influence on my musical leanings<br>
            as well, thats why I have a guitar collection and played in a band. There<br>
            was also an old Phillipines cartoon that I used to watch, thats why I learned<br>
            how to play the flute, and Sherlock was the reason I wanted to learn how to play<br>
            violin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now go back, maybe a decade or so ago, my sister bought me a cheap violin for<br>
            Christmas and till today, I still don't know how to play. TBF, I seriously wanted<br>
            to get better at guitar, and being in an original band means my time is taken by<br>
            wanting to become better at my craft (guitaring, songwriting, misc band stuff) so I<br>
            hyper-focused at that (also TBF, I'm still shit on guitar lol).
        </p>
        <p>
            The second reason was being bad at violin sounds really bad. Being bad at piano or<br>
            guitar doesn't make you sound like a dying cat screeching its' last breath - you just<br>
            sound bad but a violin is incredibly noticable. Also, I've been teaching myself for<br>
            years so I couldn't bring myself to hire a coach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward a couple of years back, maybe 2 years ago, and I bought myself an electric<br>
            violin. First problem solved, now I can only get annoyed with my bad playing. 3rd reason<br>
            was I didn't know how to use the bow properly (fixed that by putting more rosin on it) so<br>
            now, Oct 17th, I finally decided to practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm trying to learn Poor Wayfaring Stranger as this is the song I always try to learn on all<br>
            intruments that I'm learning, I know this for flute, guitar, harmonica and piano. I'm learning<br>
            it on violin right now and I might try to learn this on a Ukelele as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to get the basics down, learn this song and maybe a Christmas song. In realisty, I just<br>
            want to learn the basics and make good sounds because learning songs will be easy since I<br>
            technically know music (I still remember some theory but it's been awhile) and I have to practice<br>
            sight reading again. Then eventually, I want to write a violin ditty for an EP.
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally think violins are cool and sexy in a sophisticated way, kinda like knowing how to play<br>
            chess. Guitars are sexy in a raw emotion kinda way, kinda like how a bad boy approaches you and you<br>
            know he's a bad boy, he knows he's a bad boy and he doesn't give a fuck.
        </p>
        <p>
            But alas, I'm still far away from that sophisticated sound/form. Time to put in alot of practice lol.
