        <h3>Accept Failing</h3>
        <p>"I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. <br>
          Twenty-six times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've<br> 
          failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."<br> 
          -Michael Jordan</p>
        <p>I'm the type of fellar that doesn't like to fail, even in video games as well.<br> 
          I just personally think that it slowly conditions your mind to accept failure<br> 
          and when the life and death time comes, that chink is enough for me to lose at<br> 
          that moment.</p>
        <p>While I accept that this sort of mentality..... this not normal and it's probably<br> 
          not healthy either if I say so myself, this has been the condition I've been living<br> 
          with myself since I was a teenager and it's been alright. However, I wonder if this<br> 
          is actually efficient? How can I even test this?</p>
        <p>With that said, I've failed time and time again - and I've gotten up from it. It's<br> 
          like an inside joke for me already, I live the life of suffering and I enjoy it LOL.</p>
        <p>So I was planning on going into a Data Science position/field but as I go through<br> 
          the course [1], I find that I'm not really motivated by it. It's the same feeling<br> 
          when I thought I was thinking of going into Web Development, front end design wasn't<br> 
          really my thing either. In retrospect, I enjoy design but my ideas are kinda specialized<br> 
          which will not work as a front end developer as you need to employ a wide variety of<br> 
          design ideas for the mainstream.</p>
        <p>If I really think about it, deep down, I prefer backend development. So after some<br> 
          consideration, I decided to pivot to Data Engineering as I think it's something that<br> 
          considers all of my strengths and the idea doesn't bore me.</p>
        <p>Now onto the idea of accepting failure; I'm now in my late 30's and I'm still working<br> 
          on my path. I've tried so many ideas already and yet I've still haven't been able to<br> 
          fully commit to something. To be fair, I could've just stayed in the logistics field<br> 
          but it doesn't really interest me anymore. So we go again, and again, and again. I think<br> 
          about it and I'd rather prefer to keep searching for greatness than rather settle for<br> 
          mediocrity.</p>
        <p>Wish me luck.</p>                    
        <p>[1] I really enjoy that I can check how a field is by going through free internet courses<br> 
          and seeing if I enjoy it. With that said, it's a double edge source as it allows me a<br> 
          variety of options, but takes time to see what I would really enjoy.</p>
