    <h3>Sidebar Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>
            I really liked this system monitor, it reminded me of the widgets they have for Linux<br>
            but I found a recent error with it that the program allocates a giant chunk of memory<br>
            to it - maybe a memory leak (at one point, it took up to 5GB) but I decided to switch<br>
            off from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I'm in the process of trying to convert most of the programs I run as CLI anyways,<br>
            I figured this is the time to try out some of the monitoring apps available for windows.

            <b>ntop:</b> Kinda basic but I need something more from this.

            <b>bottom:</b> Looks good but I don't really need the graphics per se, I don't need to know<br>
            which process is running, I just need to know memory allocation with my RAM & VRAM as I<br>
            constantly benchmark pc games because I have a low spec PC lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently using bottom but I might end up writing my own app, NGL. I would need the info<br>
            such as PC name and core usages and temps, RAM usage, GPU usage and temp, network usage. and<br>
            maybe hard drive info (size mostly).
