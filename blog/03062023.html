    <h3>Personal Website v4</h3>
        <p>To be honest, I was reading though the recent hackerNews newsletter and I saw an<br>
        article regarding Vanilla HTML. I checked it out for abit and lo and behold, I really<br>
        enjoyed the aesthetic and thought to myself, why not LOL. So I started to convert this <br>
        website to vanilla HTML.</p>
        <p>As I mentioned before, I am a somewhat failed frontend web developer as I eventually<br>
        learned that I don't really enjoy the mainstream and clientele design work. I just like<br>
        certain art forms and I form my ideas around it. If I really wanted to be a webdev, I guess<br>
        I could've doubled down and become a very niche boutique developer but it didn't really<br>
        interest me enough that I would fight tooth and nail for it.</p>
        <p>With that said, I really do enjoy the vanilla look. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the<br>
        fancy websites as well but something about the barebones really resonates with my artistic<br>
        soul (LOL). One of the wordpress themes I created was pretty much a reinvention of the <br>
        minimalistic theme under the Wordpress framework so this is not something new for me. Even<br>
        my previous design is very minimalistic by todays standards.</p>
        <p>I'm currently nursing a cold at the moment so I just started doing this light work.<br>
        Hope I can be done by this week so I can work on other stuff xD.</p>
