    <h3>BBS Servers In 2023</h3>
        <p>
            For anyone who is not a boomer, they might not understand what a BBS (short<br>
            form for Bulletin Board System) - back in the day, it was pretty much the internet;<br>
            it was a very micro-centric forum that you mostly had to dial up to connect (yes..<br>
            we had to use the telephone landline to call the BBS server).
        </p>
        <p>
            If I remember correctly, I found a one through a websearch; keep in mind, this is AOL type<br>
            of internet so it was still pretty new, Netscape was still around and the remnants of the old<br>
            culture (aka BBS) was still around. I used an old laptop with a working dialup modem and away<br>
            I go. I really learned about hacking and the culture from BBS, I downloaded everything I can <br>
            every BBS I can connect to which eventually got me booked for hacking.....
        </p>
        <p>
            But that story is for another day LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast forward 2023, and they are still around - surprising since the tech age is around when IRC<br>
            was still bopping. As well, there are so many better modern alternatives like Reddit, 4Chan and<br>
            Discord that it blows BBS away. With that said, I am aware that it's mostly OG boomers that<br>
            actually remembers this technology fondly so it might just be for nostalgia. Even myself, I do<br>
            have fond memories of BBS as mentioned above. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So with that all said and done, I think I might setup a BBS LOL.
