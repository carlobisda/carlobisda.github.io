    <h3>1864 Weeks Left.....</h3>
        <p>I started this practice about a year ago when I started reading more of stoicism<br>
        philosopy - this practice is relevant to the saying of "Memento Mori", which translates <br>
        to "Remember you must die". Essentially, it's about reminding yourself of your mortality <br>
        and that since life is so short, you must focus on living you best life and try to downplay <br>
        the non-essentials.</p>
        <p>I'm paraphasing of course but that is essentially what the saying is. Also it might<br>
        seem that I have a fatalist sort of mentality but TBH, I feel like I need the constant <br>
        reminder. I think it was Elon that once said in an interview that essentially, humans <br>
        tend to underestimate how much time they have while overestimating the time they need. <br>
        </p>
        <p>As well, if I look at it in a life gamification sort of way; it's like my life points<br>
        slowly going down the drain - life is a roguelike with no resets LOL. </p>
