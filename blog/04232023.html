            Life is tough but managaeble for me since I'm familiar with not<br>
            having alot (aka poor). But I need to get a move on since I can't<br>
            stay down like this.

            I started playing Raid Shadow Legends lol. I'm really enjoying this<br>
            "gacha" game but this kind specifically, not like Genshin - I guess<br>
            I really enjoy these resource management type of games LOL, gives me<br>
            an artificial feeling of progress. Also started to learn Flask.

            Been really into programming lately, it's been fun - I've accepted the<br>
            fact that I'll never be elite and that the skills I will learn will lean<br>
            more towards reverse engineering and OSINT themed.

            Really want to do some sort of camping, but not on tents or stealth camping.<br>
            I really don't want to deal with rodents.
