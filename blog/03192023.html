    <h3>Github.IO Migration</h3>
        <p>I was reading an article off hackernews (and it was interesting mind you) but something<br>
        about the authors domain caught my eye, it read as author.github.io. I've seen this a couple<br>
        of times already but didn't really think much of it.</p>
        <p>Until now, especially since I received an email from my web hosting that my hosting will expire<br>
        in 30 days. I've been tinkering around with the idea of personal webservers or if worse comes to<br>
        worse, migrating back to wordpress dot com. It's been fun using an webserver but if I really thought<br>
        , I wasn't using it as much as other people do. Like as you can see currently, I'm "revamping" my web<br>
        site to good ol vanilla HTML. For me, as long as I own my domain name - that's really the most important<br>
        part of a personal brand - where your content is actually laid is not as important, especially your personal<br>
        website.</p>
        <p>So I checked out githubIO and while the price is really pleasing (aka FREE), I really thought that my<br>
        personal website tied down to my github page quite appealing and also simplifies the uploading of the <br>
        newly created pages. As well, I find that I'm able to use GIT via terminal now to upload so that's one less<br>
        program (FTP) I have to use.</p>
        <p>So I started migrating all of the files, which is easy - had to amend parts of the coding that directs to<br>
        the old domain, which now I think in hindsight is something I should've waited a bit more instead of jumping<br>
        the gun right away. As well, need to migrate my old blog post to the vanilla format I'm now using.</p>
        <p>Tech stuff is so much fun.</p>
