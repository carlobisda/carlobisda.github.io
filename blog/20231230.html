    <h3>Stacking Real Life Skillz</h3>
        <p>
            These days, gaming is kinda way too competitive - it's lacking the<br>
            casual fun it used to have. Mind you, there are still casual games but<br>
            if you look at the current top 10 games, 60% is competitive in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            With my personality, I'd want to be as good as I can be, it's just my nature<br>
            so I can't play these competitive games anymore where I know my competitive<br>
            spirit will flare up; especially in these PVP games like CSGO or Apex Legends.<br>
            Heck, even DOTA2 or LoL is hardcore for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's just the matter of time investment, that's why I cutoff "playing" Raid Shadow<br>
            Legends, even though I wasn't really doing anything - I was still investing a lot<br>
            of time in it and I always think I can be leveling up my real life skills rather than<br>
            playing. TBF, I love video games but I think more of them as art or life simulator. I<br>
            don't want to consider them seriously, but that's just my personal choice - I have<br>
            nothing against people who want to dedicate their life to becoming better at it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to spend some time refocusing my mental paradigm, I know I want to "game" in the<br>
            real world more so I should cut down everything unnecessary, boil it down to my essentials.
