    <h3>My Desktop Workflow [2023]</h3>
        <p>
            I'm not a computer professional, I'm more of an avid amateur enthusiast<br>
            who got exposed to the hacking scene way early in his childhood and gravitated<br>
            towards it because it resonated with his soul. It's been 2 decades since and <br>
            I still thoroughly enjoy it. With that said, my "stack" has changed since I first<br>
            started and the software I employ, depending on the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have my staples which is currently listed in a handy powershell script so that when<br>
            I do a hard reboot, software is going to be less painfully installed. (One of the updates<br>
            that I am thankful for Microsoft.) 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever I turn on my computer, I always have a couple of things on my monitor - I run a dual<br>
            monitor setup; once you go dual, you never go back (lol). I have Terminal, File Explorer,<br>
            Notepad++, and these days - Bluestacks on the left monitor. Most of the time, my left monitor<br>
            serves passively; I'll have Discord or Excel there. I also have Sidebar Diagnostics so I can review<br>
            how hawt the PC is running at.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main monitor is just a RCA TV I plugged in to my PC, never really understood why you needed a<br>
            computer monitor unless you need it specifically for your project or gaming but TBH, it works fine<br>
            for me. I always have Chrome, ZIM and or VSCODE running. Chrome for research, ZIM is my personal<br>
            wiki and VSCODE for the l33t hackerm0n work LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            I normally do quick programming projects, or research as I am an aspiring forex trader - I eventually<br>
            want to branch out to actual gambling but that's not in the cards at the moment (see what I did there<br>
            KEKW). I also have something running in the background; either a podcast or music. I actually want to<br>
            transition into doing more physcial projects but I think I'll need a bigger workspace lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            *SIGH* So many things to do, so little time.
