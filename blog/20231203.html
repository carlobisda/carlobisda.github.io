    <h3>Life Build</h3>
        <p>
            So I recently got Cyberpunk 2077 and I've been deep diving into "meta" builds<br>
            for the game and it made me think about my life - what is the life build that I<br>
            want.
        </p>
        <p>
            So much things have happened recently that I feel like I've kinda been outta touch<br>
            with myself, my goal and path has kinda been blurry - like I know what I need to do<br>
            but the determination is not there.. I need to get excited more.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has been the kind of thinking I've been having for the past couple of months, I<br>
            know what I need to do but my energy is just in an all time low. It needs to stop,<br>
            I need to keep moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or maybe I'm just fatigued? I've been at it for so many years now that maybe I'm just<br>
            burnt out from the grind.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how do I get out of this?
        </p>
        <p>
            With that said, with what I'm feeling currently - it doesn't hurt to have a plan. Lets<br>
            take baby steps till I feel inspired to get a move on. TBH, as I'm writing this - I am<br>
            getting a little bit energized. Let me align everything in my life according to my plan.
        </p>
