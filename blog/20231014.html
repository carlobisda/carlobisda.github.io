    <h3>Retiring Raid Shadow Legends [EDIT: NVM]</h3>
        <p>
            It is Day 234 and I'm Lvl 58 in this game called Raid Shadow Legends and<br>
            I think it's finally time to retire from the "game". TBF, I only played this<br>
            game as a F2P, I never spent any money on this thing but I feel like it's starting<br>
            to become a chore to keep going and a time sink (which I don't like).
        </p>
        <p>
            The daily rewards takes around 3 hours I think to fully complete and I hate that<br>
            FOMO feeling, there is also no "real" endgame in here just grinding to that next level<br>
            and I use that term loosely since there is no real endgame here - you decide where the<br>
            endgame is and I decide that the endgame for me is here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nothing really bad about the game per se, it's just a time sink where I could be putting<br>
            my time elsewhere - I also dislike the fact that it became part of my life routine, logging<br>
            every 20:00 so I can start doing my daily grind. It's literally clicking buttons and the<br>
            ultimate timesink.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it is kinda hard to put down, I mean I got to level 58 and day 234 as a free to play player.<br>
            This is where the FOMO kicks in because I feel like I spent so much time on this and the amount<br>
            of stuff I'll be missing. Kinda funny because it's just a feeling, the game literally stops when<br>
            you stop playing - like a real gambling degen, I gets the feelings of FOMO but it's just an illusion<br>
            because you're not missing out on anything, just a potential of something but that's not a 100%<br>
            guarantee LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm speaking like a true degen gambling addict LOL. Mind you, this is prolly better than playing<br>
            roulette but TBF, I could be making money instead of wasting my time - but this time waster doesn't<br>
            risk me losing money LOL.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conundrum.....
        </p>
        <p>
            EDIT: NVM - I offloaded that to my 2nd PC, I was thinking of doing that initially but Bluestacks did<br>
            not like to cooperate with my ALT PC so I ended up looking for the PC Android emulators, and I ended<br>
            up choosing LDPlayer which seems to be alot more resource light in consumption, so I have it on there<br>
            while I do my main work in my main PC lol. Also, uninstalling Bluestacks in favor of LDPlayer in my main<br>
            PC as well.
