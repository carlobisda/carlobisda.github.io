        <h3>Why I Didn't Stream On Twitch?</h3>
          <p>A couple of years ago, I got into Twitch culture heavily - especially in <br>
            the Twitch chess community.</p>
          <p>As I watched, I thought I could do a better job than most of the streamers <br>
            I saw (in all genres) because I personally thought I'd be a better <br>
            entertainer than most and I can most likely build a better community given <br>
            the chance. (As well, I thought it'd be a neat side hustle)</p>
          <p>I probably streamed 2x and never got back into it.</p>
          <p>Why you ask?</p>
          <p>There was a couple of things but my main reason was the dependency towards <br>
            your viewers to make an income. Initially, my main motivator to stream was <br>
            for money. It's kinda hard to explain but basically, I was using "income" <br>
            as a gauge for streaming success. Views are nice and engagement was nice <br>
            but I thought that was more relevant for Youtube - for streaming, subs and <br>
            donos were king.</p> 
          <p>But with that said, I was at the point in my life where I didn't want to <br>
            have a "boss". I was transitioning off the industry I was on while working <br>
            on my stuff. I didn't like the fact that I had to rely on other people to <br>
            fund me and that I was tying myself to this form of chain - I hated the idea <br>
            and it really irked me deep in my soul</p>
          <p>But it's 2023 now and my ideas about certain things in life has changed.</p>
          <p>So I'm thinking about streaming, just need to find the resolve.</p>
