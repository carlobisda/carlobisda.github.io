      <h3>Cracking SPAki Launcher</h3>
      <p>I only really flex my l337 hax0r skillz when I need something, like I'm not like<br> 
        some of my brethren where they enjoy discovering exploits in systems and such - for<br> 
        me essentially, hacking is totally utilitarian.</p>
      <p>With that said, I find beauty in what I do. It's not as dry as I make it sound to<br> 
        be. I'm much similar to my friends but I suppose more specialized and focused.</p>
      <p>So essentially, I love playing this game called "Escape From Tarkov" but I don't<br> 
        like the online version of it as it's still technically in BETA so periodical wipes<br>
         occur. I would just like to take my time going through the game and fragging out -<br> 
         not essentially have to deal with server issues, cheaters or somewhat toxic<br> 
         playerbase.</p>
      <p>I've found various versions online where the server is emulated in your computer<br> 
        and your character progression is saved, thus creating an offline singleplayer<br> 
        version of this game. Currently, there is 2 versions; the JET version and the AKI<br> 
        version. The JET version is based off and older version of the game and has some<br> 
        forks from their version with the creators putting their own spin on the game<br> 
        (i.e Altered Escape and MTGA). The AKI version is focused on a singleplayer<br> 
        experience with a wide community support with plenty of mods to change your game<br> 
        experience to any way you want. This version is regularly supported.</p>
      <p>I play both versions but I am currently trying to play the AKI version as they<br> 
        have alot of interesting mods that I can reverse engineer. Also since they are<br> 
        more updated, the content is almost the same as the online (real) version so when<br> 
        I jump in the regular version, there isn't really a big difference. With that<br> 
        said, I have one major issue with the AKI version. I need to have the online game<br> 
        installed to play the AKI version, they put some sort of anti-piracy measure in<br> 
        their game launcher.</p>
      <p>And I thouroughly dislike that "feature".</p>
      <p>Like why do I need both version installed? You already need the original files<br> 
        to install the AKI version (the JET version, they provide the old client files<br> 
        which is a legit form of piracy) so that kinda puts a hurdle at the ones who are<br> 
        thinking of "pirating" the game. And to be fair, if someone really wants to<br> 
        pirate the game - their measure won't stop them.</p>
      <p>Like me LOL.</p>
      <p>Full disclosure, I bought the game, I paid for the most expensive tier<br> 
        (EOD Edition). This is really a one of a kind game (same thing with Counterstrike<br>) 
        so I wanted to support the developers as much as I can.</p>
      <p>Also, I'm a noobie reverse engineer - I know enough and I know the basics of what<br> 
        I need to look for but to be honest, this is my second project that I reverse<br> 
        engineered by myself. (first one was a chess program lol)</p>
      <p>My main clue was the error message it gave me when I tried to play the game without<br> 
        the online version installed, it essentially told me it needed the original game<br> 
        installed to launch their version. After that, it was going through the motions and<br> 
        finding what I needed.</p>
      <p>And now, I can play this version without having a duplicate in my hard drive.</p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
