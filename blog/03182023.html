    <h3>Doing The Arch Way, My Way</h3>
        <p>I fell in love with ArchLinux the first time I stumbled upon it years ago. I was <br>
        always in a lookout for lightweight OS since I have a pendance of using low-spec gear<br>
        and I figured eventually, my AMD computer wouldn't be able to handle the newer versions<br>
        of Windows (which was the newly released Windows 10 at that time) so I either had to downgrade<br>
        to an older Win version (I was eyeing XP or 7 nocap) or full send into a NIX distro.</p>
        <p>The problem I had with Arch was that the vanilla version doesn't do any hand holding.<br>
        I'm ok with that most of the time but my modus operandi personally has always been to strip<br>
        to the core (.....monkaHmmmm), so I would've liked a bare bones release of a variant of Arch<br>
        then strip off the "bloatware" till I know what programs are essential to run a computer.<br></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, at that time though - the only variant available was Manjaro Linux and there's<br>
        alot of extra programs in their distro, no matter which version I looked at - they had a custom<br>
        installer before but that barely worked on my hardware so I couldn't utilize it. I kept an eye out<br>
        every couple of months just to see if there is going to be a distro that I will like.</p>
        <p>Fast forward 2022 and ArcoLinux.....</p>
        <p>While I was looking for a distro to put in my netbook, I was going to put a Windows OS in there but<br>
        I wanted to use it as a throwaway security centered machine, so I ended up distro hunting again.</p>
        <p>I eventually settled for Fossapup but when I tried to install some security centered packages, they<br>
        were not available. Eventually I decided to look for an Arch distro again as the Arch challenge is still<br>
        resonating deeply in my heart (something akin to what any hardcore or soulslike gamer feels like when they<br>
        beat a boss or a challenge) and I know there is security centered packages built around Arch already so I <br>
        know the tools will be readily available.</p>
        <p>We now entered ArcoLinux as they had a couple of different distros that focused on certain things. I ended<br>
        up using the ArcoLinuxS distro as it had WIFI and BLUETOOTH packages already and I wanted networking <br>
        way with the initial install. I would've went for the XD distro, which is barebones just terminal install but<br>
        no networking out of the box so that would've been a pain on my end.</p>
        <p>My plan is that the laptop is the LIVE version and I will slowly upgrade it to have security focused tools<br>
        in hand. I will install Arco on a VM in my desktop and that will be my experimental build and whatever I like<br>
        in the experimental build, I will transfer to the LIVE build; eventually once I feel comfortable in the <br>
        environment, I will fresh install Arch and build an distro from scratch.</p>
        <p>I'm going through this because I want to be familiar with Linux really well and if I were to do alot of<br>
        backend work, Linux is gonna be my second home so I might as well be familiar with alot of it's inner workings.</p>
