    <h3>Essentialist</h3>
        <p>
            I have to focus on what I need to do with my life, while keeping a balance<br>
            of having other interests that'll keep me from burning out. So I have to decide<br>
            on what I need to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, FX trading will be the main focus. I really do enjoy the gambling rush<br>
            and I feel like going into the trading sector would scratch all of the itches. I <br>
            really need to write this down as a mind map but FX trading, arbitage, parlays, value <br>
            investing, crypto - I will go into them all.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a side note, I really did enjoy the fact that I'm winning in life at the moment.
