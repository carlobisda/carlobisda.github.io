    <h3>Playnite</h3>
        <p>
            Such a cool program/app.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was looking for something that I can organize what games I owned<br>
            and I was thinking of writing my own but I ended up looking at cloud<br>
            option but they kinda sucked, as in I had to input everything manually<br>
            - no good option to upload a batch file, till I accidentally found Playnite<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I love that I can sync my online accounts to it, and I just need to manually<br>
            add my physical games. It also syncs to an online game database which has nifty<br>
            thumbnails and info added which is a nice QOL touch. Also has a counter that shows<br>
            how much you've played the game, etc etc
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm sure there are other features that I've missed but this is just too cool nocap.
