    <h3>Walk The Walk</h3>
        <p>
            A moment of introspection....
        </p>
        <p>
            Lately, my anxiety has been in an all time high. To be fair, life has really kicked<br>
            me in the balls hard in 2023 so to the objective viewer, it sounds reasonable. But I'm<br>
            not interested in the problem per se, I'm more interested in finding a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I really think about it, its feel like my anxiety resistance is in an all time<br>
            low. Like in technical terms, it feels like the filter has been battered and overused<br>
            and I am leaking or the mental shield is degrading, etc. or in another sense, my resistance<br>
            has been worn down to the point where I've been weakened. Overall, my mental defense is in<br>
            an all time low.
        </p>
        <p>
            But how do you go about strengthening your mental defenses? Is there like books of psychology<br>
            that even treat this kind issue. I could always go back to the wyrd arcane ways of the world<br>
            but deep down, I don't think it's worth it..... but at the point of where I am now, should I<br>
            rediscover.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, down to the rabbit hole I go to figure out things again.
