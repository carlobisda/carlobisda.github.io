    <h3>Single Player Tarkov</h3>
        <p>
            With my previous post, I wrote about how much I love Tarkov but there's a caveat.<br>
            I don't love the "online" identity of the game; the wipes, the META, the cheaters,<br>
            the technical aspects that makes the game bad, the bugs that hasn't been fixed yet<br>
            since forever. The game sounds right now is so bad IMHO, and the AI is just meh most<br>
            of the time. The flea market kinda ruins the survival aspect of the game, looting is<br>
            just for the sake of making money and not that useful. TBF, it's a whole complicated<br>
            ecosystem but I'm just talking about the standard EFT gameplay, ratting and min-maxing.
        </p>
        <p>
            TBF, its not the players fault - they are the product of the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how do I get my EFT fix, I play the offline single player mod. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The modding scene is nothing new, PC gamers have been enjoying this privilege since the<br>
            beginning of time. From texture upgrades to QOL mods, most PC games has someone tinkering<br>
            about making the game to their liking and vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter <a href="https://www.sp-tarkov.com/">AKI</a>- a single player server mod for Escape from Tarkov.
        </p>
        <p>
            First off I like these server mods, because these online games wont be up forever and I want to<br>
            be able to play the game when it's all said and done. Secondly, I want to be able to play at<br>
            my own pace - just grind the levels without getting wiped out in a few months, I really dislike<br>
            that part. Thirdly, I just want to shoot stuff with pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to play the JET mod but eventually moved to AKI because the community support is great, so<br>
            much mods to choose from and the AKI version is always updated to the newest patch version of the<br>
            online EFT wheareas JET has been stuck to a really old version. You have to own EFT and you need the<br>
            game installed to play the mod (hate that part but if you are nifty, like I am, you can circumvent it).
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been playing the recent patch and slowly adding the mods that I feel make the game closer to a<br>
            singleplayer survival looter shooter RPG game w/ PVE & PVP aspects. Below is the list of mods I have<br>
            installed to get the base game closer to what I think it should be (no disrespect to Nikita, love the<br>
            game you made bro and I can't wait for the final version LOL)
        </p>
        <p>
            BotCallsigns-v1.4: mods the PMC names so they are closer to the derange naming scheme of the online<br>
            environment LOL.<br>
            <br>

            probability, this kinda changes that.<br>
            <br>
            ServerValueModifier: my base mod, you can change so much in the server values with this. I made my own<br>
            preset based off another preset to push the game closer to a more survival game.<br>
            <br>
            Skwizzy-NoDiscardLimit: AI mod that makes the bots loot stuff.<br>

            <br>
            Virtual's Custom Quest Loader: custom quest loader for custom missions, not really sure why I installed this<br>
            since I'm not running any custom missions..yet.<br>
            <br>
            zzDrakiaXYZ-Waypoints: bot mod that expands the bots reach in the game, essentially widens their patrol which<br>
            makes the game feel more alive as they can show up out of nowhere, emulates player scav behaviour.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            AmandsHitmarker.dll: QOL mod that adds hitmarkers in game, justy so satisfying NGL.<br>
            <br>
            DrakiaXYZ-BigBrain.dll: AI mod, extra logic lib for other mods.<br>
            <br>
            dvize.BushNoESP.dll: AI mod that "blinds" AI so they don't have perfect vision.<br>
            <br>
            dvize.DadGamerMode.dll: game mod, essentially God Mode lite if activated.
            <br>

            Endurance.dll: game mod that makes you gain endurance no matter what.<br>
            <br>
            ThatsLit-Release.dll: game mod that hides you from perfect AI vision when you are in a bush or under a<br>
            shadow.<br>
            <br>
            Tyrian-Radar.dll: game mods that adds a radar in game, cuz the sound tracking sucks and I can't track<br>
            anything because of how dark the game looks.<br>
            <br>
            TYR_DeClutterer.dll: performance mod.<br>
            <br>
            dvize.EOH.dll: AI mod that makes PMC fight against each other, like in live Tarkov.<br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also run DWM_lut, to change how the game looks but not using post effect. And SPT profile editor as<br>
            some missions in game is bugged and you just gotta complete it unfortunately. You can use it to edit<br>
            you character profile mostly, give you extra stuff or activate certain aspects of the hideout, or just<br>
            boost your character skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I chose the mods that changes macro aspects of the game, and the AI. I added some performance mods<br>
            but thats the smoothen out the FPS, I don't need the performance boost when I run live as the server is not<br>
            running in the same PC. As well, I tend to avoid mods that changes mechanics of the game so no recoil fix or<br>
            FOV fix, or the no inertia mod.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I can enjoy the game at my own pace while, PVP is not something I would die for anyways. I get enough PVP<br>
            playing chess or third strike.
