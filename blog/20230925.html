    <h3>My Favorite Free & Open Source Software</h3>
        <p>
            To me, open source programs = free, not the fake ones where they have that<br>
            label but you have to pay for it somewhat (ala subscription), I consider those<br>
            not in the open source spirit. With that said, open source programs have jumped<br>
            up leaps and bounds in quality - there's always an open source equivalent to a<br>
            commercial one which is nice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a small list of open source programs I used in my main computer, my arch<br>
            laptop is eventually going to be security focused tool so I feel like it doesn't<br>
            gel with the spirit of this rant. My alt desktop is really just a file/media server<br>
            just runs Win10 as well with minimal programs installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>KDENLIVE:</b> So far my favorite video editor, I use it all the time.<br>
            I like the features it has, especially the audio subtitle creator but TBF,<br>
            I haven't played enough with it to know the advance features so I can't really<br>
            say what features it's missing in comparison to the Adobes of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Audacity:</b> For quick audio editing, this is a pretty powerful tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>LMMS:</b> An open source digital audio workstation, I think it has most of<br>
            the features one can expect from a commercial DAW, maybe plugins support but this<br>
            is the same case with Kdenlive, I haven't played with it long enough to know its'<br>
            limits.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Archlinux:</b> My favorite linux distro, I enjoy the elitism that comes with the<br>
            distro (LOL) but I moreso enjoy the minimalism that it comes with. It reminds me of<br>
            my Windows DOS days where I had to install everything myself for my desktop to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>RSSGuard:</b> My current RSS reader. Mind you, I'm creating my own TUI RSS reader<br>
            because I want mt RSS reader in the terminal. But I liked this one as a GUI compared to<br>
            QuietRSS - not really a big reason, I liked RSSGuard design better I suppose.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>ZIM:</b> My personal wiki, I use it as one would use Notion. When I was looking to create<br>
            my own personal wiki, I had an idea of what I wanted; offline first off, then a simple file<br>
            system and creation (this wiki uses markdown text files and simple folder directory) - just<br>
            in case I wanted to create something more robust out of it (like encrytion or sync across all<br>
            platforms - all a WIP BTW).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Notepad++:</b> I take alot of notes, and I also do alot of editing so Notepadd++ is my goto<br>
            just because I always end up editing the same files all of the time so the "recently opened files"<br>
            feature is really nice but TBF, if nano had that feature - I think I will jump at it full time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Minetest:</b> My favorite Minecraft clone (I do own Minecraft as well lol, bought it to support<br>
            the developer lol, not that he needs my money). I remember installing this a decade ago and the mod<br>
            support was ok but these past few years, the mod support has really gone up a level.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Barrier:</b> An open source virtual KVM. I used to have this setup manually between my main and alt<br>
            desktop but now since I have this installed, I have it running on all of my computers and laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm pretty sure I'm missing a bunch that I use but these are the ones that are a staple of my work<br>
            flow that I remember offhand. I don't use open source office suite programs like Libre nor do I generally<br>
            do visual art editing (I do have GIMP installed but I mainly use Paint or Canvas)
        </p>
