    <h3>Overclocking a GT730</h3>
    <p>As you may know, I run a low spec setup because its’ more cost effective <br>
      for me (and it was a gift from my sister). I only buy brand new tech once <br>
      I know I really need it; for example, guitars. I can’t really get away with <br>
      buying a cheap version of a SG anymore because I can tell the quality <br>
      difference.</p>

      <p>As well, the PC is so powerful that it’s actually pretty fun trying to <br>
        wring out as much power as you can out of it.</p>
      
      <p>For my current PC, my budget has always been under a $100 GPU. I’ve been <br>
        lucky enough to grab some low profile ones so I didn’t have to do any <br>
        heavy modifications on the PC setup. I started off with a 710 and upgraded <br>
        to a 730. With that said, this was when we were in a GPU shortage so I <br>
        wasn’t effectively buying – just wanted to have a little more oomph.</p>
      
      <p>Not OC’ed, the 730 initial stats were core running on 800MHZ w/ the VRAM <br>
        running around 800MHZ at full core usage, heat temp around 50C.</p>
      
      <p>So I ended up deciding to overclock the GPU because, well its fun and <br>
        interesting.</p>
      
      <p>For overclocking software, I tried using GPU Tweak III first but as soon <br>
        as I set the setting to “OC”, and it was only a slight bump on the core <br>
        MHZ – my computer felt sluggish and the performance, especially for EFT <br>
        was down – more stutters, lag, etc.</p>
      
      <p>I then decided to use MSI Afterburner and after watching a Youtube video <br>
        on how to do it. It was suggested to bump the sliders of the core mhz field <br>
        first, slowly, until the benchmark breaks – then work on memory clock mhz <br>
        till the benchmark breaks. Core Voltage, the video suggested, is not worth <br>
        the hassle of overclocking. The video also suggested to set the Power and <br>
        Fan Speed sliders to the max but since this GPU is not build like that (no <br>
        fan, just heat dispenser and since its a low profile – power I guess is <br>
        kinda capped).</p>
      
      <p>For heat dispersion, if needed to, I have an external OC fan that I turn on <br>
        to help.</p>
      
      <p>So for my settings, Core MHZ is set to +175 and Core Clock MHZ is set to <br>
        +75 which is like 1000Mhz/850Mhz when engaged. For the benchmark, I ran it <br>
        on the games I normally like to play; Escape from Tarkov, Rust, and CSGO – <br>
        obviously, I am running these games on the lowest setting possible, without <br>
        low spec graphics mods, just vanilla settings.</p>
      
      <p>For EFT; in the Factory map (which is the lowest resource hogging map), I <br>
        get around 40-60+ FPS except when there’s a heavy firefight, in which I <br>
        didn’t track the FPS because…. well I was busy fighting them off. For <br>
        customs, a steady 30+ FPS. (side note: always weird that this game responds <br>
        better to .50 downscale instead of .75 or even off)</p>
      
      <p>For Rust; 40 to 70.<br>
      
        For CSGO, 60 to 100. Frames drop when I am in a fire fight but not as bad as <br>
        before when the GPU was overclocked. side note: I wish I can overclock my RAM <br>
        but Dell propriety BIOS….. sadge<br>
        
        Anyways, just that little overclock helped my games run better. I can’t wait <br>
        to try fighting games like Tekken and see how they fare.</p>
