    <h3>Wealth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            As someone for the majority of their life, wasn't concerned about money<br>
            in general, the shift to giving wealth more value (pun intended) has been<br>
            a struggle of sorts. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy making money, I do enjoy<br>
            spending the money - and we can all go in the philosophical journey of how I'm<br>
            just filling my empty soul with things which doesn't really help the actual<br>
            life problem but TBH, logically, having no money these days pretty much is like<br>
            having no power to compete in the modern world.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be fair, there are plenty of ways to compete in the world; you can go in a loner<br>
            sort of wilderness vibe that or you can just violently take what you want. But with<br>
            that said, there are costs to doing things a certain way and I'm not willing to go down<br>
            the paths I mentioned above because I feel like the cost will be me more than I want.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I choose to make money, lots of money; money = powah!!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am just so at awe at people who are money/hustle mentality. For example, some people are<br>
            making bank off writing cheats for video games, or the extremely popular influencer market, <br>
            actual entrepreneurs or startup gurus.
        </p>
        <p>
            But alot of these means factor in people, people who are willing to spend their money on you.<br>
            Personally, I've never been a fan of those - thats why I never bothered with following these<br>
            trends. My thinking has always been to make money off gaming the system, not the people. To an<br>
            extent, I can't avoid people as they are the other players but I do not enjoy taking money off<br>
            sheep in a sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Focus!! Shift your mental game to making money, acquiring wealth and assets, and playing in the<br>
            macro level of the world.
