    <h3>November Haul</h3>
        <p>
            LOL, bought some more games - I've realistically just settled to becoming a game<br>
            collector instead of player, I should collect some more books though NGL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition<br>
            I started playing this game again and I love it. To be fair, I only had 1 run through<br>
            with it before the PS3 decided to delete all of my save files.<br>
            <br>
            Cyberpunk 2077:<br>
            I had to buy it, I love this genre lol.<br>
            <br>
            STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl<br>
            I have heard so much about this game, and I've seen it played, and I love the genre<br>
            so I bought it to add to my collection.<br>
            <br>
            Half Life:<br>
            A classic, and it was for free so it was a no brainer.<br>
            <br>
            Killer Instinct:<br>
            Technically my first fighting game ever played. Well the original one that is from SNES<br>
            , not sure why it was free in Steam but I'm gonna yoink it no issue. :D<br>
            <br>
            Star Wars: KOTOR:<br>
            Need I say more?<br>
            <br>
            Doom 3:<br>
            I wasn't a fan of the game, I played the SNES port of it and I thought it was cool but it<br>
            never really grabbed me but Doom 3 for PC is slick, with modern FPS mechanics and the atmosphere<br>
            , I was down for this game.
            <br>
            Deliver Us Mars:<br>
            The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk:<br>
            Master of Orion 1&2:<br>
            Tower of Guns:<br>
            Surviving the Aftermath:<br>
            Earthlock:<br>
            QUBE<br>
            Invincible Presents, Atom Eve:<br>
            Retro Combat:<br>
            Stagelands:<br>
            Monster Hide:<br>
            Planet S:<br>
            Three Skies:<br>
