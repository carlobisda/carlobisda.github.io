      <h3>NVIDIA Quadro K20000</h3>
        <p>I ended up buying this GPU, just to boost up my computers performance.</p>

          <p>TBH, I didn’t realize how… lacking my current knowledge in regards to <br>
            current technology, like I knew the basics but for someone who likes to <br>
            get down and dirty with his hardware, there was some gaping holes in my <br>
            knowledgebase.</p>
          
          <p>For example. I didn’t realize how important the generation of the CPU is – <br>
            I thought MHz and RAM size was the deciding factor BUT clock speeds is <br>
            really important these days. Like now I know my current hardware is 8 <br>
            generations behind the current one (sheesh) or that DDR5 is the minimum <br>
            really.</p>
          
          <p>Anyways like I said, I wanted to boost my computers GPUs’ power BUT not <br>
            break the bank. As well, I needed a GPU that was low profile; I wasn’t <br>
            willing to hard mod my setup unless I found a really good card. As well, <br>
            I was thinking of finally upgrading to a gen12 setup (maybe, still 50/50 <br>
            ngl).</p>
          
          <p>My benchmarks as always are the games I normally play alot; Escape from <br>
            Tarkov, Rust, CSGO & Minecraft. All of these games are set in the lowest <br>
            setting possible.</p>
          <p>CSGO and Minecraft are probably the lowest resource hungry games and they <br>
          were running from 60’ish FPS to 100+FPS with the new GPU. Rust used to ran <br>
          around a smooth 30+ish FPS but now it’s running on 60FPS (not sure but FPS is <br>
          capped for Rust, could be because of my monitor or if I did it manually with <br>
          some wizarding).Tarkov used to run on 25-30FPS but now is between 45-60FPS. <br>
          Not sure what happened but initially, it used to run better (around 50-60) – <br>
          not sure if it’s settings that I made (I tend to play with settings alot).</p>
          
          <p>TBH, as long as I can game around 60FPS, I don’t really care about details 
            LOL. Even with a PC, still a console gamer in heart.</p>
