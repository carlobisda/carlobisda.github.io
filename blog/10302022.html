                    <p>I ended up buying this GPU, just to boost up my computers performance.</p>

                      <p>TBH, I didn’t realize how… lacking my current knowledge in regards to current technology, like I knew the basics but for someone who likes to get down and dirty with his hardware, there was some gaping holes in my knowledgebase.</p>
                      
                      <p>For example. I didn’t realize how important the generation of the CPU is – I thought MHz and RAM size was the deciding factor BUT clock speeds is really important these days. Like now I know my current hardware is 8 generations behind the current one (sheesh) or that DDR5 is the minimum really.</p>
                      
                      <p>Anyways like I said, I wanted to boost my computers GPUs’ power BUT not break the bank. As well, I needed a GPU that was low profile; I wasn’t willing to hard mod my setup unless I found a really good card. As well, I was thinking of finally upgrading to a gen12 setup (maybe, still 50/50 ngl).</p>
                      
                      <p>My benchmarks as always are the games I normally play alot; Escape from Tarkov, Rust, CSGO & Minecraft. All of these games are set in the lowest setting possible.</p>
                      
                      CSGO and Minecraft are probably the lowest resource hungry games and they were running from 60’ish FPS to 100+FPS with the new GPU.<br>
                      
                      Rust used to ran around a smooth 30+ish FPS but now it’s running on 60FPS (not sure but FPS is capped for Rust, could be because of my monitor or if I did it manually with some wizarding).<br>
                      
                      Tarkov used to run on 25-30FPS but now is between 45-60FPS. Not sure what happened but initially, it used to run better (around 50-60) – not sure if it’s settings that I made (I tend to play with settings alot).
                      
                      <p>TBH, as long as I can game around 60FPS, I don’t really care about details LOL. Even with a PC, still a console gamer in heart.</p>
