    <h3>Retiring RSL (FORREAL)</h3>
        <p>
            I wrote before that I was going to retire from playing Raid Shadow<br>
            Legends but I changed my mind since I found a way to kind circumvent<br>
            my initial problem of taking time away from me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been thinking about it again recently and I'm not just a gamer, I<br>
            admit - I don't find pleasure in relaxing playing video games. I am<br>
            just wired to get better at them - I don't find playing it casually fun<br>
            , even when I was playing Super Mario, I was trying to find the META<br>
            way to beat it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I don't find value in keep playing RSL, its taking up my time while<br>
            not contributing any skill and value. It was fun, don't get me wrong,<br>
            in a dumb game kinda way but if I were to respect my time, then I should<br>
            move on from this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Goodbye Raid Shadow Legends, it was fun.
        </p>
