                    <h3>Capstone Project - Currency Analysis Pt 1</h3>
                    <p>I decided to do my first capstone data science project on Forex, as I am currently on working on an algorithm for it so I might as well kill 2 birds with one stone. To be fair, I will prolly do something easier in between but this is a slow, work in progress (mind you, not that slow I hope – maybe before 2022 ends).</p>

                      <p>After doing a couple of hours of research, I found the “template” I am going to follow, click here.</p>
                      <p>My plan is to basically reverse engineer what Daniel Chen did with his work and then revise and optimize it to what I actually need. After an initial review of the project, its’ all very basic and to be fair, it’s enough to showcase data science skills.</p>
                      <p>I however needs something abit more “zesty” as I’m abit ahead in the learning curve from him at this point of his project (to be fair, from his bio, it seems that he is way more advanced than I am but maybe in the business side of brokerages, not in the actual trading aspect of it).</p>
                      <p>So first, I coded the website using something simple – like a bootstrap template. I like having a framework established already so I can see what I need to finish and work from that point. The final product will be different as I tend to change stuff along the way and I’m creating things that I will be using as soon as it is done. I’m essentially bootstrapping a trading operation from scratch.</p>
                      <p>So the first order of business, having an economic calendar on hand.</p>
                      <p>I was initially playing around with what I can do with the MyFXBook API but it is very lacking for advanced methods. To be fair, I didn’t play around with it long as I found another resource that is pretty close to what I need but with a different website.</p>
                      <p>[side note: when bootstrapping projects or businesses, it’s easier to find an existing project and copy it initially and add your own twist to it if needed. maybe this is a gray/black hack sort of method but the world is a jungle and only the smartest will survive. as long as it can easily fit the stack you’re currently on. there’s no sense of trying to integrate something to your stack, lets say assembly, if you don’t know assembly]</p>
                      <p>I found a better fitting resource with investing.com and I implemented it.</p>
                      <p>Now for the second part, being able to view and download the information to my desktop.</p>
