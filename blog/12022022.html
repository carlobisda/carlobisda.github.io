      <h3>Capstone Project - Currency Analysis Pt 1</h3>
        <p>I decided to do my first capstone data science project on Forex, as I am currently<br>
           on working on an algorithm for it so I might as well kill 2 birds with one stone. <br>
           To be fair, I will prolly do something easier in between but this is a slow, work <br>
           in progress (mind you, not that slow I hope – maybe before 2022 ends).</p>
        <p>After doing a couple of hours of research, I found the “template” I am going to <br>
          follow, click here.</p>
        <p>My plan is to basically reverse engineer what Daniel Chen did with his work and <br>
          then revise and optimize it to what I actually need. After an initial review of the <br>
          project, its’ all very basic and to be fair, it’s enough to showcase data science <br>
          skills.</p>
        <p>I however needs something abit more “zesty” as I’m abit ahead in the learning curve <br>
          from him at this point of his project (to be fair, from his bio, it seems that he is <br>
          way more advanced than I am but maybe in the business side of brokerages, not in the <br>
          actual trading aspect of it).</p>
        <p>So first, I coded the website using something simple – like a bootstrap template. I <br>
          like having a framework established already so I can see what I need to finish and <br>
          work from that point. The final product will be different as I tend to change stuff <br>
          along the way and I’m creating things that I will be using as soon as it is done. I’m <br>
          essentially bootstrapping a trading operation from scratch.</p>
        <p>So the first order of business, having an economic calendar on hand.</p>
        <p>I was initially playing around with what I can do with the MyFXBook API but it is <br>
          very lacking for advanced methods. To be fair, I didn’t play around with it long as I <br>
          found another resource that is pretty close to what I need but with a different <br>
          website.</p>
        <p>[side note: when bootstrapping projects or businesses, it’s easier to find an existing <br>
          project and copy it initially and add your own twist to it if needed. maybe this is a <br>
          gray/black hack sort of method but the world is a jungle and only the smartest will <br>
          survive. as long as it can easily fit the stack you’re currently on. there’s no sense <br>
          of trying to integrate something to your stack, lets say assembly, if you don’t know <br>
          assembly]</p>
        <p>I found a better fitting resource with investing.com and I implemented it.</p>
        <p>Now for the second part, being able to view and download the information to my <br>
          desktop.</p>
