    <h3>Low Spec Video Convertion</h3>
        <p>
            I download my animes, especially the ones I really like. However,<br>
            I don't like the fact that the subtitle group I follow (erai-raws)<br>
            don't released under 480p. To be fair, it's a personal preference;<br>
            I just don't like having bloat and I find 480p at around 500mb is<br>
            just too much for my liking, especially when I see other releases<br>
            that has seasons of anime under 1GB.
        </p>
        <p>
            I haven't messed around video for so long so I don't really know why,<br>
            I could almost understand TV shows but anime should always be in the<br>
            lowest spectrum. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So I started to convert all of my media files into 360p.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this, I am using FFMPEG and I'm offloading the work to my 2nd PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            First I tested it out, by converting Ahsoka MKV files into MP4 and it worked<br>
            great so I then ran it on an anime that I just finished but as soon as I check<br>
            the video, there was one part missing... the subtitles.
        </p>
        <p>
            After doing some google-fu, I didn't really find a good solution so I just<br>
            decided to re-encode into MKV as well. I ran it and the video size was great<br>
            (400mb to 70mb) and I didn't really lose quality and I still have the subtitles.<br>
            Currently, I am working on a custom Powershell script to handle batch processing.<br>
            It's nothing fancy, run the same line of code but includes a 25sec pause to give<br>
            the computer a break. I tried to run a brute force convertion of a whole season<br>
            but it crashed midway. I am hoping the pause is enough to give the processor a<br>
            break but not lose the automation of the whole process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>The Next Day.....</u></b>
        </p>
        <p>
            So it seems that FFMPEG has some issues with weird/long filenames so I end up renaming<br>
            the files into simple filenames (01.mkv, 02.mkv, etc). I did it this way because the<br>
            script I wrote ends up taking the original filename and using it for the output file so<br>
            I have a episodic progression. As well, I wrote the script to pause for 2 minutes before<br>
            going in for the next try - there seems to be a pause midway but I think it's because of the<br>
            computer rather than program because when I run the script in my daily driver, I don't have<br>
            that pause like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now to go through 10k worth of anime LOL.
