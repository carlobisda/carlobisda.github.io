    <h3>I Am Lost?????</h3>
        <p>
            Since my fathers passing, maybe moreso when the Sheila/Davis/180 Smoke debacle<br>
            happened, so it's been a while back - I felt like my ship (aka my life) has been<br>
            captainless, I'm just not motivated in life, just passing through like a soulless<br>
            wanderer aimlessly wandering the world looking to fill my soul with something...<br>
            anything....
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been trying so HAAARD to do something about it but I'm just not motivated, like<br>
            I'm going through the motions of trying but I know deep inside, the fire is not getting<br>
            lit - it's just a slow ember that's slowly going to die if I don't do anything about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So where should I head? Do I need to retreat into the mountains to become a hermit so that<br>
            I become enlightened, do I need Jesus in my life?
