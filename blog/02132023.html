      <h3>Create Instead of Consume</h3>
      <p>Maybe I've mentioned before but I truly enjoyed tinkering. That's why I somewhat<br> 
        gravitate towards RAD (rapid application development) tools because I want to create<br> 
        quickly, I'm not really interested in complete "mastery" per se. I see those things<br> 
        as tool and the quicker I can create my vision, the better for me.</p>
      <p>That's why I am enjoying chatGPT so much, it's like the easiest version of what I<br> 
        use Google for - quickly search for solutions. I already created a bunch of stuff<br> 
        thanks to it.</p>
      <p>I've noticed recently that my passion for "creating" has dwindled, especially since<br> 
        I stopped creating music - which was my main passion for creating. I am to change that<br> 
        by limiting things that I consume; twitch TV is my main time sink these days, then<br> 
        video games and making tools of creation much more accessible to me.</p>
      <p>So I started uninstalling most video games in my main computer, with the exception<br> 
        of games I use as educational tools for my neice. I installed RPG Maker MV and FPS<br> 
        Creator so I can whet my appetite on some quick game creation. I also cleaned up my<br> 
        Python environments so I can systemize my tool development. There are some tools<br> 
        already installed that I utilize somewhat infrequently (like video editing, music<br> 
        creation tools and Arduino programming environment) that I will focus on getting on,<br> 
        and I will drive myself to play some more guitar.</p>
      <p>And with the mention of chatGPT, I've been really keen on machine learning; I've<br> 
        been playing around with DeepFakeLab with great success and will be playing around<br> 
        with AI voice synthesizer for my next project.</p>
      <p>I've also been on a good routine of physical exercising, need to work on calorie<br> 
        restriction but I think I am on track. And this website is somewhat an output of<br> 
        creation so there's that.</p>
      <p>I'm still unsure on video creating (vlogging), I'm trying because I'm fond of<br> 
        capturing but I don't know if I'm fond of content creation. [1] Even with this<br> 
        website, to an extent, is just a mind dump for me; it's not really for consumption<br> 
        of others.</p>
      <p>Overall, I've been on a good pace with the start of 2023.</p>
      <p>[1] As I wrote that sentence, I made a realization; maybe I should get the idea<br> 
        of "content creation" out of my head (content creation in a sense that it's for<br> 
        consumption of others) and just realize that it's for personal use and if people<br> 
        like it, so be it. With that said, I do have an idea for a focused content creation<br> 
        project.</p>
