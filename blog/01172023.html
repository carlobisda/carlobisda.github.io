        <strong>Heya!</strong> What I write here doesn't reflect me professionally nor is the stance my company takes.

                    <h3>Not Smart</h3>
                    <p>I went to a job interview yesterday and the COO made a comment regarding my resume, which I was applying for a job that I'm overqualified for. I kinda laughed it off but it made me personally think.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I don't think I'm very smart - compared to the traditional smart folks, but I do have my gifts with that said.</p>
                    <p>One of them is that I'm dumb LOL.</p>
                    <p>Let me clarify, I'm dumb in a sense that I will power through something pass common sense. I need to see it through, and by default, I used to take action alot more. My secret in general is that I work hard, and diligently - and I am a quick learner, thus giving the illusion that I am "smart".</p>
                    <p>So I tend to be "street" smarts backed w/ some "book" smarts - I personally believe my youngest brother is smarter than me in a traditional sense.</p>
