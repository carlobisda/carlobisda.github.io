      <h3>Not Smart</h3>
        <p>I went to a job interview yesterday and the COO made a comment <br>
          regarding my resume, which I was applying for a job that I'm <br>
          overqualified for. I kinda laughed it off but it made me personally <br>
          think.</p>
        <p>Personally, I don't think I'm very smart - compared to the traditional <br>
          smart folks, but I do have my gifts with that said.</p>
        <p>One of them is that I'm dumb LOL.</p>
        <p>Let me clarify, I'm dumb in a sense that I will power through something <br>
          pass common sense. I need to see it through, and by default, I used to <br>
          take action alot more. My secret in general is that I work hard, and <br>
          diligently - and I am a quick learner, thus giving the illusion that I <br>
          am "smart".</p>
        <p>So I tend to be "street" smarts backed w/ some "book" smarts - I <br>
          personally believe my youngest brother is smarter than me in a traditional <br>
          sense.</p>
