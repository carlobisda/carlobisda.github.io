    <h3>My Favorite Windows Tools</h3>
        <p>
            I conside myself a Windows poweruser. I've lived in the Microsoft environment<br>
            since the DOS era, running DOS on my x76 PC and laptop, reading alot of hacker<br>
            material BTW. Ive ran with Win95, XP, 7 and currently 10. My favorite so far has <br>
            been XP lol, I am still cheesed that the forced me to upgrade but these iterations<br>
            has been fun, especially with incorporating Nix elements (package managers) and better<br>
            tool (Powertoys, WinHotKey, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            So it shouldn't come as a surprise that I love myself some of the Windows programs, and<br>
            I use them regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Scoop:</b> I really enjoy this package manager. Not only is it CLI, it is scriptable<br>
            thus my installation time when I eventually hard reset this computer is going to be alot<br>
            more faster than before.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Paint:</b> I use this for all my image editing and creation, so simplistic. If I need<br>
            something fancy, I use Canvas or edit with Irfanview.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Office 97 Suite:</b> I love this version of Microsoft Office and I still use it to this<br>
            day. Offline, no need for internet connection, and still has almost the same power as its'<br>
            modern equivalent. TBH, I only really use Excel and sometimes, Powerpoint - I rarely use <br>
            Word.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>PowerToys:</b> The ultimate program for Windows customization. I really enjoy the primitive<br>
            tiling feature it has - would be nice if I can customiza it more to work like DWM per se.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Task Scheduler:</b> Just started using this to automate some stuff like opening my wakeup playlist<br>
            in the morning to hype me up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Media Player Classic:</b> My favorite media player, I normally use it to play music though as I find<br>
            subtitles work better with VLC player but TBF, I normally watch shows that has the subtitles hard<br>
            coded in the video so I can just as easily convert back to this. Wish it had some visualizations though<br>
            when playing music.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Windows Terminal:</b> My newest favorite tool to work with. I'm fond of the CLI environment but I'm<br>
            not an elitist (maybe a little bit KEKW) but I really like this because of the tab terminal feature since<br>
            I prefer opening tabs rather than opening new windows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I love the Windows enviroment because it really gives the ultimate flexibility for me. I can <br>
            run video games easily, or mainstream programs, it is widely supported platform, etc etc. With that said<br>
            , it is a closed system for the most part so if you're a customization andy like myself; you'll eventually<br>
            grab a Linux box to play around yourself. But overall, Windows is a great daily driver who takes your info<br>
            and sell it to the highest bidder (KEKW).
