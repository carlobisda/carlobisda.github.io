    <h3>Cheating In Video Games</h3>
        <p>I mainly play this FPS extraction looter shooter called Escape From Tarkov and <br>
        right now, it's exceptionally infested with cheaters. The community is always up and arms <br>
        about it - just a couple of days ago, a company game launcher plugin was hacked <br>
        and a cheater merchant was advertised (LMAO) when you open it.</p>
        <p>Not here's what I think about cheaters/cheating in general, it's simple economics.</p>
        <p>Hackers are just hackers, basically they are a fundamental in the world. These cheat <br>
        developers will make cheats for whatever is popular - so basically Supply & Demand. There's <br>
        a demand for it so the cheat developers will supply the demand. I essentially think this is <br>
        a human condition, that alot of people wants to cheat thus cheat developers supply the cheats. <br>
        If there was no one that wanted to cheat in EFT, there would be no cheat developers for the <br>
        game; well not in the large outbreak that we have right now, just the normal miscreants but <br>
        overall, it will be a miniscule percentage of the player base.</p>
        <p>No matter what your motivation is, cheating is cheating; I'm not going to play the social <br>
        morality card here cuz I for one has skirted the lines here and there just to get to a achieve a <br>
        certain goal but with that said, I feel like this is nothing new - just more magnified due to the<br>
        connectiveness of everyone in the gaming sphere. TBH, I would like to see which regions have more <br>
        cheaters active in games (if that is even possible).</p>
        <p>I for one don't see an easy solution unless we take an extreme approach like in South Korea where <br>
        if you were caught cheating, you're essentially banned for life.</p>
        <p>P.S: I'm actually surprised how much cheaters there are in extraction looter games initially, I <br>
        expected it more in competitive games but I feel like almost every FPS type games have cheaters. I <br>
        for one hasn't seen a UNO or Monopoly cheater but I wouldn't be surprised if there is LOL.</p>

        <p><em>why so mad bruh?</em></p>
