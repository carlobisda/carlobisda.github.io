    <h3>I Love The Star Wars Universe</h3>
        <p>
            Ok, I'm gonna be honest - I love some of the Star War movie aspects but<br>
            not all of it - like I wasn't a big fan of the ideology, I always thought<br>
            that the Jedi order was too archaic in thinking, especially something that<br>
            is supposed to be set in the future. I didn't like how polished the movie<br>
            universe was - everything felt so psuedo-utopian. Luke & Leai were kinda meh<br>
            characters for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            But with that said, I really enjoy the ideas that came out of the original<br>
            trilogy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To be more concise, I like the gritty aspects of Star Wars.

            I love the aspect of the universe that Han Solo lived in, the gritty underground<br>
            parts of Star Wars. I like the urban city-scapes Anakin explored. I love the idea<br>
            of the Mandolorians. I like the extended universe. I like Ahsoka, Sabine, and General<br>
            Syndulla (I really enjoy Mary Elizabeth Winstead lol, I think she's so cool since Scott<br>
            Pilgrim). I like the games. I like the tech. Heck, I even enjoyed Rey & Kylo Ren.

            I enjoyed most episodes of the Mandolorian. I just finished watching Obi Wan. I'm watching<br>
            Ahsoka right now. I played some of Jedi Fallen Order. I might start playing KOTOR instead of<br>
            finishing Mass Effect II. I enjoyed playing alot of Jedi Knight and I think Kyle Katarn is the<br>
            streotype of an awesome anti-hero. I like the idea of playing around with the good and dark side<br>
            of the force. I might start collecting some stuff about the extended universe soon ngl.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I enjoy the Star Wars universe - just not the mainstream things people enjoy I suppose.
