    <h3>DELL 3020SFF Optiplex</h3>
      <p>Here are some notes regarding the Dell 3020SFF (Small Form Factor) <br>
        Optiplex, my current workhorse which I use for development, editing, <br>
        and light gaming.</p>
      <p>I ended up choosing the Optiplex because it was a gift from my sibling <br>
        and I didn’t want her to pay alot for a gift of mine. Around that time, <br>
        I was just checking out the recent trends with budget gaming builds and <br>
        one of the popular trends was repurposing these Optiplexs’.</p>
      <p>Optiplex Notes
      So here are my notes when I started my Optiplex modding journey:</p>
      <p>There are 3 Intel CPU models that normally comes out with the Optiplex <br>
        models, choose the i7-4790 if you can. 16GB RAM is the max this motherboard <br>
        can take. I tried installing a Timetec 16GB but it bricked the computer, I <br>
        thought I picked the correct specs. SSD can only be installed with SATA <br>
        ports.</p>
      <p>There’s alot of Dell propriety connectors, like power block is 8pin.<br>
        If you unplug fan and front end temp control, it will brick the computer <br>
        till you put it back on so be careful with case modding.<br>
        The fan will only give an error but you can still continue to boot in.<br>
        Temp control will fully brick the computer.<br>
        You cannot overclock RAM and CPU.<br>
        You have a limited option of GPUs that you can use, mostly low profile because <br>
        the space between the slot and the power block is tight.<br>
        You can use a 8pin extender to move the power block so you can have more space.<br>
        I suggested low profile GPUs because they take the same power from the motherboard, <br>
        didn’t experiment yet GPUs’ that needs extra power.<br>
        No WIFI with motherboard.</p>
      <p>As an office PC or technical PC, this PC will work; it will have no problems <br>
        handling low to mid (to mid-high) applications from Microsoft Office to video <br>
        editing and encoding.<br>
        For gaming, it will mostly run low to mid spec games (like games optimized for <br>
        net play like CS:GO or Genshin Impact).</p>
      <p>Your GPU will affect this abit BUT you the overclock option is available if <br>
        needed.<br>
        For visibility, here are some benchmarks with my current setup. Optiplex 3020SFF, <br>
        SSD Drive, GT730 (no OC).<br>
        CS:G0 – 60 to 100ish FPS, lowest setting.<br>
        Rust – 30-40 FPS lowest setting.<br>
        Genshin Impact – 50ish FPS lowest setting.<br>
        Escape from Tarkov – CPU bound PC, 30ish FPS, lowest setting.</p>
      <p>So basically, any 3D game that is graphically optimized will run in low to mid <br>
        setting you just have to play around with the setting for abit. Getting a better <br>
        GPU that is meant for gaming will likely help.</p>
