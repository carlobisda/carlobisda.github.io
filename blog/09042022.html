                    <h3>DELL 3020SFF Optiplex</h3>
                    <p>Here are some notes regarding the Dell 3020SFF (Small Form Factor) Optiplex, my current workhorse which I use for development, editing, and light gaming.</p>
                    <p>I ended up choosing the Optiplex because it was a gift from my sibling and I didn’t want her to pay alot for a gift of mine. Around that time, I was just checking out the recent trends with budget gaming builds and one of the popular trends was repurposing these Optiplexs’.</p>
                    <p>Optiplex Notes
                    So here are my notes when I started my Optiplex modding journey:</p>
                    <p>There are 3 Intel CPU models that normally comes out with the Optiplex models, choose the i7-4790 if you can.
                      16GB RAM is the max this motherboard can take.
                      I tried installing a Timetec 16GB but it bricked the computer, I thought I picked the correct specs.
                      SSD can only be installed with SATA ports.</p>
                    <p>There’s alot of Dell propriety connectors, like power block is 8pin.
                      If you unplug fan and front end temp control, it will brick the computer till you put it back on so be careful with case modding.
                      The fan will only give an error but you can still continue to boot in.
                      Temp control will fully brick the computer.
                      You cannot overclock RAM and CPU.
                      You have a limited option of GPUs that you can use, mostly low profile because the space between the slot and the power block is tight.
                      You can use a 8pin extender to move the power block so you can have more space.
                      I suggested low profile GPUs because they take the same power from the motherboard, didn’t experiment yet GPUs’ that needs extra power.
                      No WIFI with motherboard.</p>
                    <p>As an office PC or technical PC, this PC will work; it will have no problems handling low to mid (to mid-high) applications from Microsoft Office to video editing and encoding.
                      For gaming, it will mostly run low to mid spec games (like games optimized for net play like CS:GO or Genshin Impact).</p>
                    <p>Your GPU will affect this abit BUT you the overclock option is available if needed.
                      For visibility, here are some benchmarks with my current setup. Optiplex 3020SFF, SSD Drive, GT730 (no OC).<br>
                      CS:G0 – 60 to 100ish FPS, lowest setting.<br>
                      Rust – 30-40 FPS lowest setting.<br>
                      Genshin Impact – 50ish FPS lowest setting.<br>
                      Escape from Tarkov – CPU bound PC, 30ish FPS, lowest setting.</p>
                    <p>So basically, any 3D game that is graphically optimized will run in low to mid setting you just have to play around with the setting for abit. Getting a better GPU that is meant for gaming will likely help.</p>
