    <h3>Universe 2077</h3>
        <p>Universe 2077 is my multi-media science fiction/cyberpunk project part <br>
        of a bigger multi-genre universe. I plan to create and release various media <br>
        projects such as short stories, video games, etc, in this universe and hope to <br>
        have a very "alive" piece of art in the end.</p>
        <p>My work here is my love letter to the cyberpunk genre as I've been greatly <br>
        influenced by it; Neuromancer, Snow Crash, Cowboy Bebop, Akira, Minority Report and <br>
        Psycho Pass (to name a few) has been my influences in regards to content I mainly<br>
        enjoy.</p>
