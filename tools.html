        An overview of all the computing tools I currently employ for projects<br>
        and for play as well. My philosophy regarding computers or technology in<br>
        general is not having the most powerfull tool in the shed - I find more<br>
        joy in re-speccing old gear for modern usage. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some aspects I don't mind having the best of the best, like guitars or where<br>
        performance really matters (like cars or most electronics) - the bliss of squeezing<br>
        every bit of power you can from a more weathered machine is absolutely fantastic.

        This was a birthday present from my sister but I've been out of the loop<br>
        in regards to hardware for years, I remember this Optiplex because there<br>
        was a year where everyone was buying this for budget gaming builds.
    </p>
    <p>
        This my daily driver, I mainly use to program, techie stuff or browse the<br>
        youtubez - I occasionally game on this if I feel like it. Mostly used for<br>
        research purposes and trading ideas. I feel like there a 1 millisecond lag<br>
        doing stuff but I feel like it's more of a Windows 11 problem than a computer<br>
        problem because if I reinstall Windows 7 or Arch on this, performance would not<br>
        be an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        I use Windows Terminal, VSCode, and Office Suite 97 mostly on this. I run<br>
        Google Chrome as my main browser as well so I don't have to worry about<br>
        syncing my stuff and I faily use Google tools alot. I am now using the Scoop<br>
        package manager mostly. I also use this for work sometimes but I might but <br>
        a laptop for that as I tend to reset my computer and I don't want to have to <br>
        call my IT guy every month or so LOL.
    </p>
    <p>
        As well, I have a couple of mechanical keyboard and mice that I switch around<br>
        whenever I feel like but I only use mechanical keyboard and gaming mices. I'm<br>
        a firm believer of tactile responses and muscle memory so I tend to use the <br>
        same tools over and over again.

        This was my main daily driver for years, also the first PC I bought and built<br>
        myself. I mainly use this as a backup, a file server, media player & computational<br>
        projects that I want to offload. I also sometimes use it as a private game server.
    </p>
    <p>
        I mostly played PC games on this LOL or web stuff, not a lot of technical stuff as I<br>
        always had a spare computer running where I was doing my projects. I feel like I didn't<br>
        do as much technical stuff with this PC but I was probably wrong, I just can't remember<br>
        what I used to do on this, some programming maybe?
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh music stuff, I was really heavy into music production when this was my daily driver.

        I mainly use this to play around the ArchLinux environment where my future progression<br>
        with it is to use for cybersec fun. I use pacman for managing applications, Alacritty<br>
        for terminal l33tness and bash as a shell. All of my PCs' are running Barrier KVM so <br>
        I can jump around easiliy between them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This laptop, while I don't want it to happen, is my throwaway gear since I'll be trying<br>
        to pull off some dubious stuff on this LOL.

        More to come as I am working on bringing back 2 ASUS computers and some sort of<br>
        Rasperberry project.
