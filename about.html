    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>
            Introverted most of the time, my personal philosophy in dealing with life in general is observe<br>
            quietly but take action swiftly. I maintain a healthy balance between risk and caution. <br>
            The notable thinkers that has influenced my way of thinking include Bruce Lee, Miyamoto Musashi,<br>
            Socrates, Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jordan Peterson (WIP), Che Guevara, The Clash, Jack White,<br> 
            Stoicism, Bushido, Taoism, Dadaism and Minimalism.
        </p>
        <p>
            My top 5 movies are (in no particular order); The Big Sleep, The New Guy, The Patriot, Into the Wild,<br>
            and 300.
        </p>
        <p>
            My top 5 bands are ACDC, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, The Clash and Rory Gallagher. (p.s: I have a soft spot<br>
            for T Swift KEKW)
        </p>
        <p>
            To be honest, I believe the scope of my "self" can't be captured within a few lines of code and that I<br>
            can only provide snapshots of it currently. For the most part, my fundamental core values of balance,<br>
            progression and strength will not change - the resulting ideas and philosophies that spawn because of <br>
            how life has dealt my cards and the outcomes that shaped me are always changing as I weave through the <br>
            world while learning new things about it, and myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wish my fellow travellers well.
        </p>
