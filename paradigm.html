        <h3><u>Paradigm</u></h3>
            <p>
                This is a repository, but serves more as a manifesto and a personal <br>
                tome of wisdom, which also serves as a reminder for myself (because to <br>
                be honest, my mind goes into alot of paths).
            </p>
        <h4><u>Humanist</u></h4>
            <p>
                I've been a humanist at early age and I will probably start to delve into it <br>
                more in some way, shape and form through online means.
            </p>
            <p>
                My ideas and philosophies are currently in a state of work in progress. There <br>
                is so much to learn and synthesize and once I think I have some sort of grasp <br>
                or footing on a matter, a new term or idea pops out that I have to investigate <br>
                and learn.
            </p>
        <h4><u>Hacking</u></h4>
            <p>
                Since I got my old PC, there was no way to escape the path of being a hacker. For <br>
                a more intimate reading that reflects my personal ideas of hacking; google <br>
                <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html">"The Hacker Manifesto"</a>
                and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/101/pg101.txt">"The Hacker Crackdown"</a> by Bruce Sterling<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm essentially a cyberpunk kiddie LOL.
            </p>
        <h4><u>Relationships</u></h4>
            <p>
                I've on the mind of a charitable eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, it's all situational <br>
                for me I suppose. Fundamentally, I truly do believe for an eye for an eye scenario; like <br>
                if you try to fook me, then you just gave me the pass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does that mean I have to? That's left to my discretion. My thought process regarding on <br>
                taking action is how grave the offence is? Is it time consuming? And how my pleasure would I<br>
                incur from it. Sounds psychotic, yeppers.
            </p>
            <p>
                But to be fair, I do understand that humans makes mistakes so it really just boils down to <br>
                how fooked up said offense was or my mood lol.
            </p>
        <h4><u>Current Events</u></h4>
            <p>
                Most people won't understand, nor would care (which is understandable) but we <br>
                are living in a time of changes. I mean as living beings, we are always changing <br>
                but if you haven't noticed - we have been shifting in quite a rapid pace and I <br>
                think as a race - we weren't prepared on how technology would affect us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even I was affected by this and I had to step back and rebalance my life priorities <br>
                to accomodate this wave of change.
            </p>
        <h4><u>Politics</u></h4>
            <p>
                For all intents and purposes, I am moderate for most of the ideals but I tend to lean towards ideals <br> 
                that are a tad extreme and centers around human development. (Hyper-Centrist, is that a word LOL?)
            </p>
        <h4><u>Philosophy</u></h4>
            <p>
                My personal philosophy is a mix of Eastern and Western thinkings, I am still working on<br>
                crystalizing my own philosophy ideals into some sort of concrete piece of work but for now,<br>
                I will just list the notable thinkers (or ideas) that has influenced my way of thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bruce Lee, Miyamoto Musashi, Socrates, Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jordan Peterson (WIP),<br>
                Che Guevara, The Clash, Jack White, Stoicism, Bushido, Taoism, Dadaism, Minimalism, <br>
                Essentialism.
