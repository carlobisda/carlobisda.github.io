        <h3>Paradigm</h3>
        <p>This is a repository, but serves more as a manifesto and a personal <br>
            tome of wisdom, which also serves as a reminder for myself (because to <br>
            be honest, my mind goes into alot of paths).</p>
        <h4>Me?</h4>
        <p>Fundamentally, I have conservative beliefs in regards to humans but will <br>
            not fight progress. Most of the time, I believe in the individual potential<br> 
            for greatness while disdain the human herd mentality.</p>
        <p>With that said, I have very human tendencies; I enjoy gambling, games, <br>
            physical activity, technological lust, music, etc.</p>
        <p>I don't have any real formal education or credentials past high school. For <br>
            the most part, it's been through life experiences and self study.</p>
        <h4>Humanist</h4>
        <p>I've been a humanist at early age and I will probably start to delve into it <br>
            more in some way, shape and form through online means.</p>
        <p>My ideas and philosophies are currently in a state of work in progress. There <br>
            is so much to learn and synthesize and once I think I have some sort of grasp <br>
            or footing on a matter, a new term or idea pops out that I have to investigate <br>
            and learn.</p>
        <h4>Current Events</h4>
        <p>Most people won't understand, nor would care (which is understandable) but we <br>
            are living in a time of changes. I mean as living beings, we are always changing <br>
            but if you haven't noticed - we have been shifting in quite a rapid pace and I <br>
            think as a race - we weren't prepared on how technology would affect us.</p>
        <p>Even I was affected by this and I had to step back and rebalance my life priorities <br>
            to accomodate this wave of change.</p>
        <h4>GameStop Squeeze</h4>
        <p>I saw no market manipulation on the retail traders - just a prime example of the human<br>
            condition. I mean they saw a way to stick it to the man after many years of being <br>
            kicked down and the same entities being helped out after their mistakes while the muggles<br>
            were left to hold the bag.</p>
        <p>I'm more suspicious about the financial institutions who did all they can to stop the squeeze<br>
            , Robinhood being one of the main bad actors. What kind of proof do I have? Just historical facts<br>
            which makes me believe that is their modus operandi.</p>
        <h4>BLM</h4>
        <p>I don't really have a take on this since this is a pretty human action if I really thought about.</p>
        <p>Personally, I feel that all human lives matter but I can see why the need to take such a <br>
            tribalistic POV is necessary. I understand it is an ideal that's not necessarily taken in by<br> 
            everyone (or realistically possible), myself included as if I have to choose between humanity or<br> 
            my family, I will choose my family.</p>
        <h4>Politics</h4>
            <p>I guess I am in the middle for most of the ideals.</p>
        <h4>Philosophy</h4>
            <p>My personal philosophy is a mix of Eastern and Western thinkings, I am still working on<br>
            crystalizing my own philosophy ideals into some sort of concrete piece of work but for now,<br>
            I will just list the notable thinkers (or ideas) that has influenced my way of thinking.</p>
            <p>Bruce Lee, Miyamoto Musashi, Socrates, Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jordan Peterson (WIP),<br>
            Che Guevara, The Clash, Jack White, Stoicism, Bushido, Taoism, Dadaism, Minimalism, <br>
            Essentialism.</p>
