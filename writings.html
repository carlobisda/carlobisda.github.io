            <b><u>TRSTheBand:</u></b><br>
            Previously, I was the lead vocals and guitarist of a power trio called<br>
            "The Rebel Skyliners". We played modern rock with punk, americana and blues<br>
            stylings. We are technically, as a band, in hiatus but I might start doing some<br>
            digital stuff - TBF, 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Editorial - Guitar Justice:</u></b> Wrote some pieces on a local musician zine<br>
            called Guitar Justice, years ago click <a href="writings/guitarJustice.PNG">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>House of Fall:</b></u> been playing around this idea centered around a multi-dimension<br>
            lead character which spans multiple genres. Idea initially started from an urban fantasy<br>
            POV but I might stretch it out to sci-fi as well. I guess this is more of a universe centered<br>
            around one character.

            <b><u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shonenfanatic">Shonen Fanatic:</a></u></b><br> 
            My anime review youtube which I sometimes update on and off. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Jolene, a fanfic set in the Cowboy Bebop universe:</u></b><br>
            I remember in the 90s' when geocities was still around, someone made a fanfic set in the Cowboy<br>
            Bebop universe which I thought pretty fucking cool. Too bad I can't remember it or I would read<br>
            it again prolly ala Wayback Machine. With that said, I kinda want to write one myself.
