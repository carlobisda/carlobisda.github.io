        <p><b><u>TRSTheBand:</u></b><br>
        Previously, I was the lead vocals and guitarist of a power trio called<br>
        "The Rebel Skyliners". We played modern rock with punk, americana and blues<br>
        stylings. We are technically, as a band, in hiatus but I might start doing some<br>
        digital stuff - TBF, </p>
        <p><b><u>Editorial - Guitar Justice:</u></b> Wrote some pieces on a local musician zine<br>
        called Guitar Justice, years ago click <a href="writings/guitarJustice.PNG">here.</a></p>
        <p><b><u>House of Fall:</b></u> been playing around this idea centered around a multi-dimension<br>
        lead character which spans multiple genres. Idea initially started from an urban fantasy<br>
        POV but I might stretch it out to sci-fi as well. I guess this is more of a universe centered<br>
        around one character.</p>
